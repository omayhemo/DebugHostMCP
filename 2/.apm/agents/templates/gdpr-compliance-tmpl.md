# GDPR Article 25 Compliance Template
## Data Protection by Design and by Default

### Article 25 Requirements Validation

#### 1. Data Protection by Design
- [ ] **Technical and organizational measures** implemented at time of determination of means of processing
- [ ] **Privacy-friendly defaults** implemented in system design
- [ ] **Data minimization** principles applied throughout data lifecycle
- [ ] **Purpose limitation** enforced in data collection and processing
- [ ] **Storage limitation** implemented with automatic deletion/anonymization
- [ ] **Accuracy measures** implemented for data quality assurance
- [ ] **Security measures** appropriate to processing risks implemented

#### 2. Data Protection by Default
- [ ] **Minimal data processing** - only necessary personal data processed by default
- [ ] **Limited processing purposes** - data processed only for specified, legitimate purposes
- [ ] **Minimal storage period** - data stored only as long as necessary for purposes
- [ ] **Limited accessibility** - personal data not accessible to indefinite number of individuals

### Implementation Checklist

#### Data Collection
- [ ] **Lawful basis** identified and documented for each data processing activity
- [ ] **Consent mechanisms** implemented where required (clear, specific, informed, freely given)
- [ ] **Data subject information** provided at point of collection (transparency)
- [ ] **Purpose specification** clear and documented
- [ ] **Data minimization** applied - only collect what is necessary

#### Data Processing
- [ ] **Processing records** maintained as required by Article 30
- [ ] **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** conducted where required
- [ ] **Privacy by design** principles embedded in system architecture
- [ ] **Automated decision-making** safeguards implemented where applicable
- [ ] **Data sharing agreements** in place with third parties

#### Data Subject Rights
- [ ] **Right of access** - mechanisms for data subjects to obtain confirmation and copy of data
- [ ] **Right of rectification** - ability to correct inaccurate personal data
- [ ] **Right to erasure** - "right to be forgotten" implementation
- [ ] **Right to restrict processing** - ability to limit processing in certain circumstances
- [ ] **Right to data portability** - ability to receive data in structured, machine-readable format
- [ ] **Right to object** - mechanisms for objecting to processing

#### Security Measures
- [ ] **Pseudonymization** implemented where appropriate
- [ ] **Encryption** of personal data at rest and in transit
- [ ] **Access controls** limiting who can access personal data
- [ ] **Audit logging** of data access and processing activities
- [ ] **Data breach procedures** established and tested
- [ ] **Staff training** on data protection principles and procedures

### Data Sanitization Requirements (IMMEDIATE)

#### Sprint 3-4 Specific Requirements
- [ ] **Immediate sanitization** of personal data upon collection
- [ ] **Real-time data masking** in logs and monitoring systems
- [ ] **Automated data deletion** after retention period expires
- [ ] **Data anonymization** for analytics and reporting purposes
- [ ] **Secure data disposal** procedures implemented

#### Technical Implementation
- [ ] **Input validation** prevents collection of unnecessary personal data
- [ ] **Data transformation** pipelines include sanitization steps
- [ ] **Database triggers** enforce data retention policies
- [ ] **API responses** exclude sensitive personal data by default
- [ ] **Logging frameworks** automatically redact personal information

### Validation Evidence Required

#### Documentation
- [ ] Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) completed
- [ ] Privacy Notice updated and accessible
- [ ] Data Processing Register maintained
- [ ] Staff training records maintained
- [ ] Third-party data sharing agreements reviewed

#### Technical Evidence
- [ ] Code review demonstrating privacy by design implementation
- [ ] Test results showing data minimization enforcement
- [ ] Security scan results confirming data protection measures
- [ ] Penetration testing reports for data access controls
- [ ] Data retention policy automated enforcement demonstration
