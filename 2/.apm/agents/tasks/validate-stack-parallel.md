# Task: Parallel Stack Validation

## Objective
Execute comprehensive technical stack validation in parallel across multiple domains for 70% faster assessment than sequential validation.

## Context
Validate React 18+ Vite + Redux Toolkit stack feasibility against project constraints: <200KB bundle size, <200MB memory, <2s load times, single developer capacity (21 points/sprint).

## Parallel Subtasks (Execute ALL in single response)

### Subtask 1: Technology Compatibility Assessment
**Prompt**: "Analyze React 18+ Concurrent Features compatibility with Vite build system and Redux Toolkit. Focus on: automatic batching impact on performance, Suspense integration with RTK Query, new JSX Transform effects on bundle size, and development workflow efficiency. Provide compatibility matrix and any version-specific constraints."

### Subtask 2: Bundle Size Feasibility Analysis
**Prompt**: "Evaluate bundle size feasibility for target <200KB with React 18 + Vite + Redux Toolkit + Chart.js stack. Analyze: tree shaking effectiveness, code splitting strategies, dynamic imports for Chart.js, RTK Query bundle impact, and realistic size estimates for dashboard components. Include optimization recommendations."

### Subtask 3: Performance Prediction Analysis
**Prompt**: "Predict performance characteristics for <200MB memory and <2s load time targets. Evaluate: React 18 concurrent rendering memory usage, Redux Toolkit DevTools impact, Vite production bundle performance, initial vs. subsequent load times, and Chart.js rendering performance. Identify potential bottlenecks."

### Subtask 4: Development Workflow Assessment
**Prompt**: "Assess development workflow efficiency for single developer with 21 points/sprint capacity. Analyze: Vite HMR speed and reliability, Redux Toolkit DevTools debugging capabilities, TypeScript integration complexity, testing framework compatibility, and realistic development velocity estimates."

### Subtask 5: Risk and Mitigation Analysis
**Prompt**: "Identify technical risks in React 18 + Vite + Redux Toolkit stack and mitigation strategies. Focus on: browser compatibility issues, Chart.js memory leak risks, SSE/WebSocket integration challenges, Docker API CORS concerns, and fallback strategies. Prioritize risks by impact and probability."

## Synthesis Requirements
After ALL subtasks complete:
1. Create compatibility matrix with Green/Yellow/Red feasibility ratings
2. Generate bundle size projection with optimization roadmap
3. Document performance predictions with specific metrics
4. Provide development velocity assessment against sprint capacity
5. Prioritize risks with specific mitigation strategies
6. Generate final feasibility recommendation (FEASIBLE/FEASIBLE WITH CONSTRAINTS/NOT FEASIBLE)
