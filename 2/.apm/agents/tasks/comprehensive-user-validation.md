## Task Execution Framework

### Phase 1: Requirements Discovery & Mapping (15 minutes)

**Objective**: Locate and catalog all user-focused requirements, stories, and acceptance criteria.

**Actions**:
1. **Document Discovery**: Use search tools to locate all requirements documents
2. **User Context Mapping**: Map provided user context to documented requirements  
3. **Persona Requirements Matrix**: Create matrix of requirements serving each persona
4. **Initial Gap Assessment**: Identify obvious missing elements for user experience

**Tools**: Grep, Glob, Read tools for comprehensive document analysis

**Deliverable**: Requirements Discovery Report with persona mapping matrix

### Phase 2: User Needs Alignment Validation (20 minutes)

**Objective**: Validate that technical requirements align with specific user persona needs and pain points.

**Focus Areas**:
- **Developer Pain Points**: Slow debugging cycles, context switching, tool fragmentation
- **DevOps Pain Points**: Container management complexity, lack of integrated monitoring
- **Team Lead Pain Points**: Limited visibility into team debugging efficiency and bottlenecks

**Validation Process**:
1. Execute `/validate-user-needs` command framework
2. Map each requirement to specific user personas  
3. Validate pain point resolution through requirements
4. Assess contribution to "40% faster debugging" target
5. Identify persona coverage gaps

**Deliverable**: User Needs Alignment Report with persona-specific validation

### Phase 3: Acceptance Criteria Completeness Review (25 minutes)

**Objective**: Comprehensive analysis of all 131 acceptance criteria for quality, testability, and user focus.

**Analysis Framework**:
- **Story 3.1 (Dashboard)**: Foundation user interface requirements
- **Story 3.2 (Log Viewer)**: Core debugging experience requirements  
- **Story 3.3 (Metrics)**: Monitoring and oversight requirements
- **Story 3.4 (Controls)**: Operational efficiency requirements

**Quality Dimensions** (Equal Weight):
1. **Completeness**: SMART criteria, Given-When-Then format, testability
2. **User Focus**: Written from user perspective, addresses user workflows
3. **Coverage**: All personas served, all workflows supported
4. **Performance Integration**: <500ms, one-click, responsiveness embedded

**Validation Process**:
1. Execute `/validate-ac-completeness` command framework
2. Analyze each story's AC for quality and coverage
3. Validate testability and implementation readiness
4. Assess user persona coverage across all 131 criteria
5. Identify critical gaps and improvement opportunities

**Deliverable**: AC Completeness Report with quality scoring and gap analysis

### Phase 4: Performance-Experience Alignment (20 minutes)

**Objective**: Validate that performance requirements enable the promised user experience improvements.

**Performance-Experience Mapping**:
- **<500ms Log Streaming** â†’ Real-time debugging feedback (25% of 40% improvement)
- **One-click Controls** â†’ Elimination of multi-step workflows (10% of 40% improvement)  
- **Responsive Dashboard** â†’ Context switching reduction (5% of 40% improvement)
- **Integrated Workflow** â†’ Combined tool efficiency gains (remaining improvement)

**Validation Process**:
1. Execute `/validate-performance-alignment` command framework  
2. Map performance requirements to user experience improvements
3. Validate 40% faster debugging target achievability
4. Analyze end-to-end workflow performance impact
5. Assess performance requirements coverage across personas

**Deliverable**: Performance-Experience Alignment Report with 40% target validation

### Phase 5: Integration & Synthesis (20 minutes)

**Objective**: Synthesize all validation findings into actionable recommendations for requirements improvement.

**Integration Analysis**:
- **Cross-Validation Consistency**: Ensure findings across all phases align
- **Priority Gap Assessment**: Identify highest-impact improvement opportunities
- **User Value Optimization**: Focus recommendations on maximum user benefit
- **Implementation Readiness**: Assess validation findings for development readiness

**Synthesis Framework**:
1. **Critical Issues**: Gaps that threaten user experience targets or persona coverage
2. **Enhancement Opportunities**: Improvements that would significantly boost user value
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Specific actions for addressing identified gaps
4. **Success Metrics**: How to measure validation improvements and user experience delivery

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive User Validation Report with prioritized recommendations
