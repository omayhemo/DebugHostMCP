# Task: Parallel Integration Validation

## Objective
Execute comprehensive integration risk assessment in parallel across 6 critical integration points for 75% faster analysis than sequential testing.

## Context
Validate integration feasibility for React dashboard with Docker API (1-3s latency), real-time SSE/WebSocket streaming, browser compatibility, and error handling requirements within resource constraints.

## Parallel Subtasks (Execute ALL in single response)

### Subtask 1: Docker API Integration Assessment
**Prompt**: "Analyze Docker API integration feasibility with 1-3s response latency constraints. Focus on: REST API compatibility with Redux Toolkit Query, authentication and CORS handling, rate limiting considerations, error response patterns, timeout strategies, and proxy configuration for development. Include integration patterns and best practices."

### Subtask 2: Real-time Streaming Integration Analysis
**Prompt**: "Evaluate SSE/WebSocket integration architecture for real-time data streaming. Analyze: browser compatibility and limitations, connection management and reconnection logic, data format and parsing performance, Redux integration patterns, error handling and fallback strategies, and resource cleanup on component unmount."

### Subtask 3: Browser Compatibility and Limitations
**Prompt**: "Assess browser compatibility constraints for React 18 + real-time features. Focus on: SSE support across browsers, WebSocket compatibility, memory management differences, concurrent rendering support, Chart.js performance variations, and mobile browser limitations. Include fallback strategies for unsupported features."

### Subtask 4: Error Handling and Resilience Strategy
**Prompt**: "Design comprehensive error handling strategy for Docker API and streaming integrations. Analyze: network failure scenarios, API timeout handling, streaming connection drops, partial data scenarios, user notification strategies, and automatic retry logic. Include error recovery patterns and user experience considerations."

### Subtask 5: Security and Authentication Integration
**Prompt**: "Evaluate security requirements for Docker API and streaming connections. Focus on: authentication token management, secure WebSocket connections (WSS), CORS policy configuration, API key security, session management, and XSS/CSRF protection. Include security best practices and compliance considerations."

### Subtask 6: Development and Testing Integration
**Prompt**: "Assess development workflow and testing strategies for complex integrations. Analyze: Docker API mocking strategies, streaming connection testing, integration test frameworks, end-to-end testing complexity, debugging tools and techniques, and CI/CD pipeline integration requirements."

## Synthesis Requirements
After ALL subtasks complete:
1. Create integration architecture diagram with component relationships
2. Generate error handling flowchart with recovery strategies  
3. Document security requirements and implementation approach
4. Provide development and testing strategy recommendations
5. Identify integration risks with mitigation plans
6. Generate integration feasibility matrix with implementation priorities
