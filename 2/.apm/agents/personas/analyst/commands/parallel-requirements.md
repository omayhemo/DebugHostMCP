# Analyst Command: Parallel Requirements Analysis

## Command Overview
**Command**: `/parallel-requirements`  
**Purpose**: Accelerated requirements analysis using native sub-agents  
**Performance**: 4x faster than sequential (4 hours → 1 hour)  
**Method**: Natural language sub-agent coordination

## Natural Language Implementation

When user requests `/parallel-requirements`, execute as Analyst persona:

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis Coordination

```markdown
I need comprehensive requirements analysis across multiple domains. Let me coordinate with specialized analysts to ensure thorough coverage.

"I need an Analyst agent to analyze stakeholder requirements and business objectives
Context: {{CONTEXT}}
Focus: Stakeholder mapping, business goals, success criteria, constraints, compliance needs, and business value validation"

"I need another Analyst agent to analyze functional requirements and use cases  
Context: {{CONTEXT}}
Focus: Use case documentation, functional specifications, user workflows, business rules, data processing, and integration requirements"

"I need an Analyst agent to analyze non-functional requirements and quality attributes
Context: {{CONTEXT}}
Focus: Performance criteria, reliability targets, security requirements, usability standards, maintainability needs, and compliance specifications"

"I need an Analyst agent to analyze technical requirements and system constraints
Context: {{CONTEXT}}  
Focus: Architecture requirements, technology constraints, integration needs, infrastructure requirements, and deployment considerations"

"I need an Analyst agent to create requirements validation and traceability framework
Context: {{CONTEXT}}
Focus: Completeness validation, consistency checking, testability assessment, prioritization matrix, and traceability documentation"
```

### Phase 2: Requirements Integration

After sub-agents complete their analysis:

1. **Business-Functional Alignment**: Validate functional requirements support business objectives
2. **Technical Feasibility Validation**: Ensure technical requirements enable functional requirements
3. **Quality Integration**: Confirm NFRs are technically achievable and measurable
4. **Stakeholder Traceability**: Verify all stakeholder needs are addressed
5. **Implementation Readiness**: Ensure requirements are complete, testable, and actionable

### Phase 3: Deliverable Creation

Generate comprehensive requirements documentation:
- **Stakeholder Requirements Matrix**: Business objectives with traceability
- **Functional Requirements Specification**: Complete use cases and workflows
- **Non-Functional Requirements Document**: Measurable quality criteria
- **Technical Requirements Framework**: Architecture and infrastructure needs
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix**: Complete requirement-to-implementation mapping

## Performance Metrics

- **Target Performance**: 4x improvement (4 hours → 1 hour)
- **Quality Measures**: Completeness, consistency, testability, traceability
- **Success Criteria**: All stakeholder needs addressed, technically feasible, implementation-ready

## Integration Points

- **Input**: Project context, business objectives, initial requirements
- **Dependencies**: Stakeholder availability, business context clarity
- **Output**: Complete requirements suite ready for design and development
- **Handoff**: Architecture team for technical design, PM for prioritization

## Usage Examples

```markdown
User: "/parallel-requirements for our e-commerce mobile app project"

Analyst: I'll coordinate comprehensive requirements analysis across all domains for your e-commerce mobile app. Let me engage specialized analysts for parallel analysis...

[Executes natural language coordination with 5 sub-agents]
[Synthesizes results into integrated requirements suite]
[Delivers complete requirements documentation in 1 hour]
```

## Quality Assurance

- ✅ All requirement types covered (business, functional, NFR, technical)
- ✅ Stakeholder traceability maintained
- ✅ Requirements are testable and measurable
- ✅ Technical feasibility validated
- ✅ Implementation readiness confirmed
- ✅ 4x performance improvement achieved
