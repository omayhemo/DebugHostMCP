# Analyst Command: Parallel Brainstorming

## Command Overview
**Command**: `/parallel-brainstorming`  
**Purpose**: Accelerated idea generation and evaluation using native sub-agents  
**Performance**: 4x faster than sequential (2 hours → 30 minutes)  
**Method**: Natural language sub-agent coordination

## Natural Language Implementation

When user requests `/parallel-brainstorming`, execute as Analyst persona:

### Phase 1: Brainstorming Coordination

```markdown
I need comprehensive brainstorming across multiple creative and analytical dimensions. Let me coordinate with specialists to maximize idea generation and evaluation.

"I need an Analyst agent for creative ideation and concept generation
Context: {{CONTEXT}}
Focus: Divergent thinking, lateral thinking, analogical reasoning, SCAMPER methodology, mind mapping, reverse brainstorming, and breakthrough concept exploration"

"I need another Analyst agent for analytical evaluation and feasibility assessment  
Context: {{CONTEXT}}
Focus: Technical feasibility, resource requirements, risk evaluation, complexity assessment, timeline estimation, and implementation pathway analysis"

"I need an Analyst agent for categorization and thematic organization
Context: {{CONTEXT}}
Focus: Thematic classification, idea clustering, relationship mapping, pattern identification, redundancy elimination, and concept synthesis"

"I need an Analyst agent for prioritization and selection framework
Context: {{CONTEXT}}
Focus: Multi-criteria decision matrix, impact-effort assessment, value proposition analysis, strategic alignment evaluation, and selection methodology"
```

### Phase 2: Idea Integration

After sub-agents complete their work:

1. **Creativity-Feasibility Balance**: Balance creative potential with practical implementation
2. **Generation-Evaluation Coherence**: Ensure evaluation respects creative vision
3. **Organization-Prioritization Alignment**: Validate categorization supports selection
4. **Analysis-Implementation Readiness**: Confirm assessment enables execution planning
5. **Selection-Value Optimization**: Optimize criteria for successful outcomes

### Phase 3: Brainstorming Synthesis

Generate comprehensive brainstorming results:
- **Creative Idea Pool**: Diverse concepts with innovative approaches
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Evidence-based implementation assessment
- **Systematic Organization**: Structured categories with clear relationships
- **Strategic Prioritization**: Objective selection framework with criteria
- **Action Roadmap**: Implementation plan for selected concepts

## Performance Metrics

- **Target Performance**: 4x improvement (2 hours → 30 minutes)
- **Quality Measures**: Idea diversity, feasibility accuracy, organization clarity
- **Success Criteria**: Actionable ideas ready for implementation

## Integration Points

- **Input**: Problem statement, objectives, constraints, success criteria
- **Dependencies**: Problem clarity, stakeholder alignment
- **Output**: Prioritized ideas with implementation roadmap
- **Handoff**: Implementation teams, decision makers

## Usage Examples

```markdown
User: "/parallel-brainstorming for improving user onboarding experience"

Analyst: I'll coordinate comprehensive brainstorming for user onboarding improvements. Let me engage creative and analytical specialists for parallel idea development...
