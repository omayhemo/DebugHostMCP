# User Needs Validation Command

## Command: `/validate-user-needs`

**Purpose**: Validate requirements against specific user personas and their documented pain points, ensuring technical specifications align with user experience goals.

## Context Requirements
Your user context specifies:
- **User Requirements**: Real-time log streaming <500ms, visual metrics monitoring, one-click container controls, responsive dashboard
- **User Personas**: Developers (primary), DevOps engineers, Team leads
- **User Experience**: 40% faster debugging, integrated workflow, reduced context switching
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 131 total criteria across 4 stories

## Execution Protocol

### 1. Requirements Discovery Phase
```bash
# Search for all requirements documents
find /mnt/c/Code/MCPServers/DebugHostMCP -name "*requirements*" -o -name "*stories*" -o -name "*acceptance*"
```

### 2. User Persona Analysis
For each persona (Developers, DevOps, Team leads):
- Map requirements to specific persona needs
- Validate pain point alignment
- Check workflow integration requirements
- Verify persona-specific acceptance criteria

### 3. Experience Metrics Validation
**Target: 40% faster debugging**
- Validate <500ms log streaming supports real-time debugging
- Check one-click controls reduce interaction time
- Verify integrated workflow reduces context switching
- Confirm responsive dashboard supports decision speed

### 4. Requirements-to-User-Needs Mapping

#### For Developers (Primary Users):
- **Pain Point**: Slow debugging cycles
- **Requirement Validation**: Real-time log streaming <500ms
- **Experience Metric**: Contributes to 40% faster debugging
- **Acceptance Criteria Check**: Verify criteria support developer workflow

#### For DevOps Engineers:
- **Pain Point**: Container management complexity
- **Requirement Validation**: One-click container controls
- **Experience Metric**: Reduces operational overhead
- **Acceptance Criteria Check**: Verify operational efficiency criteria

#### For Team Leads:
- **Pain Point**: Limited visibility into team debugging efficiency
- **Requirement Validation**: Visual metrics monitoring
- **Experience Metric**: Provides oversight and performance insights
- **Acceptance Criteria Check**: Verify monitoring and reporting criteria

### 5. Integration Workflow Analysis
- Map requirements to end-to-end user journeys
- Validate context switching reduction through integrated design
- Check workflow continuity across different user tasks
- Verify dashboard components support unified experience

## Validation Output Format

### Requirements-User Alignment Report

```markdown
# User Needs Validation Report

## Executive Summary
[Overall alignment assessment with user needs]

## Persona-Specific Validation

### Developers (Primary Users)
**Requirements Serving This Persona:**
- [List with alignment assessment]

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- [Specific pain points and how requirements address them]

**Experience Metrics Achieved:**
- [How requirements contribute to 40% faster debugging]

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**
- [Number of AC specifically supporting developers]
- [Coverage gaps identified]

### DevOps Engineers
[Same structure as above]

### Team Leads
[Same structure as above]

## Cross-Persona Requirements
[Requirements that serve multiple personas]

## Experience Integration Analysis
**Workflow Continuity:** [Assessment]
**Context Switching Reduction:** [Validation]
**Integrated Experience:** [Evaluation]

## Gaps and Recommendations
1. [Gap 1 with specific recommendation]
2. [Gap 2 with specific recommendation]
3. [Gap 3 with specific recommendation]

## Validation Metrics
- Requirements mapped to personas: X/Total
- Pain points addressed: X/Total
- Experience metrics supported: X/Total
- AC coverage per persona: Developer(X), DevOps(Y), Lead(Z)
```

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All requirements trace to specific user personas
- ✅ All personas have adequate requirements coverage
- ✅ 40% faster debugging target is supported by requirements
- ✅ Context switching reduction is validated through integrated design
- ✅ All 131 acceptance criteria serve identified user personas

## Follow-up Actions
Based on validation results:
1. **High Priority**: Address persona coverage gaps
2. **Medium Priority**: Enhance experience metric alignment
3. **Low Priority**: Optimize acceptance criteria specificity

**Next Command Options:**
- `/validate-ac-completeness` - Deep dive into acceptance criteria quality
- `/validate-ux-standards` - Check UX compliance
- `/validate-performance-alignment` - Verify performance-experience alignment
