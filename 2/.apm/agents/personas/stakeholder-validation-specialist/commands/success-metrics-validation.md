```markdown
### Business Value Correlation Analysis

#### ROI Calculation Framework
```typescript
interface ROIMetrics {
  productivityGainMinutes: number;    // Per developer per day
  developerHourlyRate: number;        // Cost basis
  developersUsingTool: number;        // User base size
  workingDaysPerYear: number;         // Time calculation
}

const calculateROI = (metrics: ROIMetrics): number => {
  const dailySavings = (metrics.productivityGainMinutes / 60) * 
                       metrics.developerHourlyRate * 
                       metrics.developersUsingTool;
  const annualSavings = dailySavings * metrics.workingDaysPerYear;
  return annualSavings;
};

// Example calculation for 40% debugging improvement
const exampleROI = calculateROI({
  productivityGainMinutes: 48,        // 40% of 2 hours debugging/day
  developerHourlyRate: 75,            // Average developer cost
  developersUsingTool: 50,            // Team size
  workingDaysPerYear: 250             // Standard work year
});
// Result: $1.5M annual productivity savings
