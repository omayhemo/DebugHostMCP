#### 2. Stakeholder Priority Weighting
```markdown
### Weighted Stakeholder Priorities (Sprint 3-4 Focus)
- **Developers**: 35% (Primary users, productivity target)
- **DevOps**: 25% (Enterprise deployment focus)
- **Security**: 15% (Compliance requirements)
- **Compliance**: 10% (Regulatory adherence)
- **Product**: 10% (Business value validation)
- **Team Leads**: 5% (Management visibility)
```

#### 3. Gap Analysis Process
```markdown
### High-Risk Misalignment Areas (Score <7.0)

#### Auto-scroll Control (6.2/10)
**Gap Analysis**:
- Security: Concerned about log tampering visibility
- Compliance: Worried about audit trail gaps
- **Resolution**: Implement audit-safe auto-scroll with manual override logging

#### CPU Monitoring Detail Level (7.8/10) 
**Gap Analysis**:
- Compliance: Needs resource usage auditing
- Security: Requires access control for sensitive metrics
- **Resolution**: Role-based metric visibility with audit logging
```

### 4. Conflict Resolution Matrix

#### Performance vs Security Conflict
```markdown
**Identified Conflict**: Real-time streaming latency vs log data sanitization
- **Developer Need**: <500ms log display latency
- **Security Need**: PII detection and sanitization
- **Resolution Strategy**: 
  - Development mode: Raw logs (performance priority)
  - Production mode: Sanitized logs (security priority)
  - Configurable per environment
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - Dev: <500ms latency maintained
  - Prod: 100% PII detection, <1s latency acceptable
```

#### Simplicity vs Enterprise Features Conflict  
```markdown
**Identified Conflict**: Developer simplicity vs enterprise monitoring needs
- **Developer Need**: Simple, focused debugging interface
- **DevOps Need**: Comprehensive system monitoring dashboard
- **Resolution Strategy**:
  - Progressive disclosure UI design
  - "Simple" and "Advanced" dashboard modes
  - Role-based interface adaptation
- **Success Metrics**:
  - 90% developers prefer simple mode
  - 90% DevOps prefer advanced mode
```
