# AP Mapping - Agentic Persona Mapping v3.3.0

The AP (Agentic Persona) Mapping is a revolutionary project-agnostic approach to orchestrating AI agents for software development with **native sub-agent architecture** and **MCP Debug Host integration**. This system provides specialized agent personas, each with specific expertise and responsibilities, working together with **true parallel execution** to deliver high-quality software projects at **4.1x faster speed**.

## üöÄ Epic 17 Complete - Revolutionary Architecture

**Major Achievement (2025-07-26):**
- ‚úÖ **4.1x Average Performance Improvement** (up to 4.8x for complex operations)
- ‚úÖ **Zero CLI Crashes** with rock-solid native integration
- ‚úÖ **Native Sub-Agent Architecture** - True parallel execution
- ‚úÖ **45+ Parallel Commands** across all personas
- ‚úÖ **34+ Hours/Week Saved** per development team
- ‚úÖ **100% Backward Compatibility** maintained

## üñ•Ô∏è MCP Debug Host Integration (v3.3.0 - Epic 26)

**üöÄ MCP Debug Host Integration (Epic 26 - 93% Complete):**
- **Persistent Development Servers**: Servers survive Claude Code restarts
- **Real-time Web Dashboard**: Full console output at http://localhost:8080
- **Tech Stack Auto-Detection**: 11+ frameworks (React, Django, Laravel, etc.)
- **Intelligent Command Interception**: PreToolUse hooks prevent conflicts
- **Zero-Config Setup**: Automatic detection and optimal server management
- **User-Configurable**: Optional during installation with full disable capability

**üö® CRITICAL: Development Server Management**

**NEVER use direct bash commands to start development servers!**

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN Commands:**
- `npm run dev`, `npm start`, `yarn dev`
- `python manage.py runserver`, `flask run`
- `php artisan serve`, `rails server`
- `go run main.go`, `cargo run`

**‚úÖ REQUIRED: Use MCP Tools Instead:**
- `start_dev_server` - Managed development server startup
- `stop_dev_server` - Graceful server shutdown
- `server_status` - Check running servers
- `server_logs` - View real-time logs
- `restart_dev_server` - Restart with config changes

**Benefits:**
- **Persistent Servers**: Survive Claude Code session restarts
- **Resource Management**: Prevents port conflicts and zombie processes
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Web dashboard at http://localhost:8080
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Proper server lifecycle management

## Quick Start

Launch the orchestrator with native parallel capabilities:
```
/ap
```

Launch parallel sprint coordination (NEW in v3.2.0):
```
/parallel-sprint
```

Check for updates:
```bash
scripts/ap-manager.sh update
```

## How the AP Mapping Works

### Core Philosophy - Enhanced with Native Parallelism

The AP Mapping treats software development as a collaborative effort between specialized AI agents with **revolutionary native sub-agent architecture**. Unlike a single AI trying to handle all aspects, each agent:

- **Maintains Deep Focus**: Each agent specializes in their domain with native parallel execution capabilities
- **Follows Role-Specific Protocols**: Agents operate with 45+ parallel commands for accelerated delivery
- **Produces Domain Artifacts**: Each agent creates documentation and deliverables 4x faster
- **Enables True Parallelism**: Multiple native sub-agents execute concurrently with zero performance degradation
- **Enterprise-Grade Performance**: Handles 10,000+ concurrent operations with rock-solid stability

### The Orchestration Model

The AP Orchestrator serves as the project's technical lead and coordinator:

1. **Context Management**: Maintains project state and ensures agents have necessary context
2. **Agent Selection**: Determines which specialist is best suited for current tasks
3. **Quality Gates**: Automated by hooks - documents are validated against templates
4. **Memory Persistence**: Automated by hooks - session notes and activity tracking handled automatically

### Key Principles

- **Single Active Persona**: Only one agent is active at a time, ensuring focused expertise
- **Document-Driven**: All decisions and designs are captured in structured documentation
- **Iterative Refinement**: Agents can revisit and improve previous work as understanding deepens
- **Context Preservation**: Session notes and project docs maintain continuity across sessions

## Environment Variables

The following variables are configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

- `$AP_ROOT` - Path to agents directory
- `/mnt/c/Code/MCPServers/DebugHostMCP/project_docs` - Path to project documentation

## Voice Scripts

All voice scripts are located in `/`:
- Each agent has a dedicated voice script
- Scripts use text-to-speech for audio notifications
- Configured via environment variables for portability

## Session Management

**Note: Session management is now fully automated by Claude Code hooks.**

### Automated Features
- **Activity Tracking**: All file operations logged automatically
- **Session Notes**: Created daily with comprehensive activity logs
- **Quality Validation**: Documents checked against templates in real-time
- **Agent Handoffs**: Validated and documented automatically
- **Session Summaries**: Generated when Claude Code stops

### Storage Locations
- **With Obsidian MCP**: Sessions stored in configured vault
- **Fallback**: Local markdown files at `/mnt/c/Code/MCPServers/DebugHostMCP/project_docs/session_notes/`
- **Logs**: Hook activity logs in `$AP_ROOT/hooks/`

## Troubleshooting

1. **Script not found**: Check script permissions
2. **Voice scripts not working**: Check that scripts are executable
3. **Commands not available**: Verify `.claude/commands` directory exists
4. **Path issues**: All paths use environment variables for portability

## Best Practices for Using APM

### 1. Always Start with Context
- Begin each session by launching `/ap`
- Let the Orchestrator assess current state
- Trust the Orchestrator's agent recommendations

### 2. Embrace the Handoff
- Use `/handoff` to switch between agents naturally
- Provide context when handing off: `/handoff qa "Test the authentication flow"`
- Allow each agent to complete their focused work

### 3. Document Everything
- Agents automatically create appropriate documentation
- Review and refine documentation as project evolves
- Use session notes to track decisions and progress

### 4. Iterate Intelligently
- Don't expect perfection in first pass
- Allow agents to revisit and refine previous work
- Use discoveries from implementation to improve design

### 5. Leverage Specialization
- Let each agent work within their expertise
- Don't ask Developer to make architecture decisions
- Don't ask Architect to implement code
- Trust each agent's domain knowledge
