# Story 1.2 Validation - MCP HTTP Server Foundation

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

- ✅ Story goal/purpose is clearly stated: "MCP server accessible via HTTP/SSE"
- ✅ Relationship to epic goals is evident: Core infrastructure for agent control
- ✅ How the story fits into overall system flow: Primary interface for all MCP operations
- ✅ Dependencies identified: Story 1.1 for testing with containers
- ✅ Business context clear: Enable Claude Code agents to manage services

**Status: PASS**

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

- ✅ Key files identified: server.js, routes.js, handlers/, sse/streams.js
- ✅ Technologies specified: Express, express-sse, Node.js 20+
- ✅ Critical APIs described: All 4 endpoints with exact paths
- ✅ Data models referenced: MCP protocol format mentioned
- ✅ Environment variables: PORT=2601, localhost binding
- ✅ Exceptions noted: Security binding to localhost only

**Status: PASS**

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

- ✅ External references: MCP HTTP transport specification
- ✅ Critical info summarized: Endpoints listed, not just referenced
- ✅ Context provided: Why SSE for streaming logs
- ✅ Consistent format: File paths use full structure

**Status: PASS**

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

- ✅ Core info included: All endpoints, error handling, structure
- ✅ Assumptions explicit: "Keep initial implementation simple"
- ⚠️ Domain terms explained: MCP acronym not expanded
- ✅ Edge cases addressed: Port conflicts, SSE disconnections

**Status: PARTIAL** - Minor: MCP = Model Context Protocol

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

- ✅ Testing approach outlined: Unit tests for core functionality
- ✅ Key scenarios identified: Happy path, edge cases, errors
- ✅ Success criteria defined: Server starts, endpoints work, SSE streams
- ✅ Special considerations: Multiple simultaneous SSE connections

**Status: PASS**
