# Story 1.4 Validation - Develop Port Registry System

**Story**: 1.4  
**Title**: Develop Port Registry System  
**Validation Date**: January 5, 2025  
**Validator**: SM Agent  

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

- ✅ Story goal/purpose is clearly stated: "intelligent port allocation with conflict prevention"
- ✅ Relationship to epic goals is evident: Enables multiple concurrent projects
- ✅ How the story fits into overall system flow: Manages all port assignments
- ✅ Dependencies identified: Stories 1.2 and 1.3 for integration
- ✅ Business context clear: Prevent port conflicts between projects

**Status: PASS**

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

- ✅ Key files identified: port-registry.js and ports.json
- ✅ Technologies specified: net module for port checking, fs for persistence
- ✅ Critical APIs described: All allocation methods defined
- ✅ Data models: Complete JSON schema provided
- ✅ Environment variables: N/A for this story
- ✅ Exceptions noted: System port protection emphasized
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Atomic file operations pattern with complete code example

**Status: PASS**

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

- ✅ External references: Integration with MCP server and Docker manager
- ✅ Critical info summarized: Port ranges table included
- ✅ Context provided: Why each range was chosen
- ✅ Consistent format: Full paths and schemas provided

**Status: PASS**

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

- ✅ Core info included: Complete allocation logic described
- ✅ Assumptions explicit: Auto-assignment algorithm clear
- ✅ Domain terms explained: Port ranges, conflict types
- ✅ Edge cases addressed: Range exhaustion, corrupted registry

**Status: PASS**

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

- ✅ Testing approach outlined: Various allocation scenarios
- ✅ Key scenarios identified: Happy path, exhaustion, conflicts
- ✅ Success criteria defined: All 7 acceptance criteria testable
- ✅ Special considerations: Concurrent allocations, file locking

**Status: PASS**
