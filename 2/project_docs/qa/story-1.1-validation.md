# Story 1.1 Validation - Build Docker Base Images

**Story**: 1.1  
**Title**: Build Docker Base Images  
**Validation Date**: January 5, 2025  
**Validator**: SM Agent  

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

- ✅ Story goal/purpose is clearly stated: "pre-built Docker base images for each supported language"
- ✅ Relationship to epic goals is evident: Foundation for all container operations
- ✅ How the story fits into overall system flow: Base images required before containers can be created
- ✅ Dependencies identified: Docker Engine required
- ✅ Business context clear: Quick project starts without build delays

**Status: PASS**

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

- ✅ Key files identified: 4 Dockerfiles + php-watcher.sh script
- ✅ Technologies specified: Exact packages for each image listed
- ✅ Critical APIs described: Docker build commands implied
- ✅ Data models: N/A for this story
- ✅ Environment variables listed: NODE_ENV, PYTHONUNBUFFERED
- ✅ Exceptions noted: PHP needs special watcher script
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: PHP watcher script example now included

**Status: PASS**

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

- ✅ External references: Base image versions specified (node:22-slim, etc.)
- ✅ Critical info summarized: All packages listed, not just referenced
- ✅ Context provided: Why each tool is needed (nodemon for watching, etc.)
- ✅ Consistent format: Full file paths provided

**Status: PASS**

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

- ✅ Core info included: Complete Dockerfile specifications
- ✅ Assumptions explicit: Multi-stage builds for size optimization
- ✅ Domain terms explained: File watching purpose clear
- ✅ Edge cases addressed: Binary files, hidden directories in watching

**Status: PASS**

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

- ✅ Testing approach outlined: Build, start container, modify file, verify restart
- ✅ Key scenarios identified: Happy path, edge cases, error scenarios
- ✅ Success criteria defined: Images under 500MB, auto-restart working
- ✅ Special considerations: Large file changes, binary uploads

**Status: PASS**

## VALIDATION RESULT

| Category | Status | Issues |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity | PASS | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS | None - PHP script added |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness | PASS | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment | PASS | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance | PASS | None |

### Strengths
- Complete PHP watcher script example provided
