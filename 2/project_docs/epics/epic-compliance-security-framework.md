#### Story CS-005.5: Cryptographic Compliance & Monitoring
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement cryptographic strength validation
- [ ] Create encryption usage monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Build compliance reporting for encryption requirements
- [ ] Add cryptographic incident response procedures
- [ ] Design encryption key recovery and escrow

**Technical Requirements:**
- Cryptographic algorithm compliance validation
- Key usage analytics and anomaly detection
- Encryption compliance dashboards and reports
- Cryptographic incident response automation
- Secure key backup and recovery procedures

**Compliance Monitoring:**
```javascript
// Cryptographic compliance monitoring
class CryptographicMonitor {
  constructor(config) {
    this.algorithms = config.approvedAlgorithms;
    this.keyStrengths = config.minimumKeyStrengths;
    this.complianceReporter = new ComplianceReporter();
  }

  async validateCryptographicOperation(operation) {
    const violations = [];
    
    // Algorithm compliance
    if (!this.algorithms.includes(operation.algorithm)) {
      violations.push({
        type: 'UNAPPROVED_ALGORITHM',
        algorithm: operation.algorithm,
        severity: 'HIGH',
        recommendation: 'Use approved algorithms only'
      });
    }
    
    // Key strength validation
    if (operation.keyLength < this.keyStrengths[operation.algorithm]) {
      violations.push({
        type: 'INSUFFICIENT_KEY_STRENGTH',
        current: operation.keyLength,
        required: this.keyStrengths[operation.algorithm],
        severity: 'CRITICAL',
        recommendation: 'Increase key length to meet security requirements'
      });
    }
    
    // Certificate expiration
    if (operation.certificate && this.isCertificateExpiringSoon(operation.certificate)) {
      violations.push({
        type: 'CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING',
        expiresAt: operation.certificate.expiresAt,
        severity: 'MEDIUM',
        recommendation: 'Renew certificate before expiration'
      });
    }
    
    // Report violations
    if (violations.length > 0) {
      await this.complianceReporter.reportViolations(violations);
      await this.triggerIncidentResponse(violations);
    }
    
    return {
      compliant: violations.length === 0,
      violations: violations,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  }
}
```
