### Integration Framework
```
Integration Layers:
1. Event System: Platform events → Message Bus → External Systems
2. API Layer: REST/GraphQL APIs for bidirectional communication  
3. Plugin Layer: Sandboxed execution environment for custom code
4. Webhook Layer: Reliable delivery with retry and monitoring
5. Authentication Layer: Unified auth across all integrations
```

### Security Architecture
