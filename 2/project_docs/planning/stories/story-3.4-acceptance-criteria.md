    **Then** a progress bar should appear AND estimated time remaining should be shown AND a cancel option should be available

23. **Given** keyboard navigation enabled
    **When** the user presses Tab
    **Then** focus should move through controls in logical order AND focused element should have clear visual indication AND Enter key should activate focused control

### Error Handling
24. **Given** a failed operation
    **When** the error is displayed
    **Then** the error message should be in plain language AND include the specific error code AND provide at least one actionable solution

25. **Given** a network disconnection
