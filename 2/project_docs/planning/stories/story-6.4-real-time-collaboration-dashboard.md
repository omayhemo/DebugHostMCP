**Story ID**: 6.4  
**Epic**: Multi-User Support & Workspace Management (Epic 5)  
**Sprint**: 6  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: August 8, 2025  

## User Story

**As a** team member  
**I want** a real-time collaboration dashboard showing team activity and shared project status  
**So that** I can stay informed about team progress, coordinate with colleagues, and efficiently collaborate on shared development projects  

## Business Value

- **Team Coordination**: Real-time visibility into team member activities and project status
- **Productivity**: Reduces communication overhead through shared situational awareness
- **Collaboration**: Enables effective coordination on shared projects and resources
- **Project Management**: Provides team leads with comprehensive team oversight

## Acceptance Criteria

### Real-time Activity Feed
1. **GIVEN** team members are working on projects  
   **WHEN** they perform actions (start/stop containers, deploy, etc.)  
   **THEN** activities appear in the team's real-time activity feed  

2. **GIVEN** multiple team members are active simultaneously  
   **WHEN** viewing the activity feed  
   **THEN** all activities are properly attributed and timestamped  

3. **GIVEN** a team member joins or leaves  
   **WHEN** team membership changes  
   **THEN** presence status updates are reflected immediately  

### Live Project Status Dashboard
4. **GIVEN** team projects are active  
   **WHEN** viewing the collaboration dashboard  
   **THEN** real-time status of all shared projects is displayed  

5. **GIVEN** containers are running for shared projects  
   **WHEN** container status changes  
   **THEN** updates are immediately visible to all team members  

6. **GIVEN** team members access shared project logs  
   **WHEN** logs are updated  
   **THEN** real-time log streaming is available to authorized members  

### Team Member Presence and Status
7. **GIVEN** team members are online  
   **WHEN** they interact with the platform  
   **THEN** their presence status (online/away/busy) is visible to teammates  

8. **GIVEN** a team member is working on a specific project  
   **WHEN** others view the project  
   **THEN** active collaborators and their current activities are shown  

9. **GIVEN** team members set their status or availability  
   **WHEN** status changes occur  
   **THEN** updated status is broadcast to all team members  

### Collaborative Project Management
10. **GIVEN** multiple team members work on the same project  
    **WHEN** they make changes simultaneously  
    **THEN** conflict detection and resolution guidance is provided  

11. **GIVEN** a team member starts debugging or working on a project  
    **WHEN** others attempt to access the same project  
    **THEN** coordination warnings and collaboration suggestions are shown  

12. **GIVEN** shared resources (databases, services) are in use  
    **WHEN** team members check resource status  
    **THEN** current usage and available capacity is displayed in real-time  

### Communication and Notifications
13. **GIVEN** important project events occur (deployment, errors, etc.)  
    **WHEN** these events happen  
    **THEN** relevant team members receive real-time notifications  

14. **GIVEN** team members need to communicate about projects  
    **WHEN** they use integrated communication features  
    **THEN** project-specific discussions are available and persistent  

15. **GIVEN** team leads need to broadcast updates  
    **WHEN** they send team announcements  
    **THEN** notifications are delivered in real-time to all team members  

### Performance and Scalability
16. **GIVEN** teams with up to 20 members  
    **WHEN** all members are active simultaneously  
    **THEN** real-time updates maintain <2 second latency  

17. **GIVEN** high activity levels in team projects  
    **WHEN** many events occur rapidly  
    **THEN** the dashboard efficiently handles and displays updates without performance degradation  

## Technical Requirements

### Real-time Communication Architecture
```typescript
// WebSocket event types for collaboration
interface CollaborationEvent {
  type: 'user_presence' | 'project_activity' | 'container_status' | 
        'team_notification' | 'resource_update' | 'chat_message';
  teamId: string;
  userId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  data: any;
}

// Presence status tracking
interface UserPresence {
  userId: string;
  status: 'online' | 'away' | 'busy' | 'offline';
  currentProject?: string;
  currentActivity?: string;
  lastSeen: Date;
  socketId: string;
}

// Project collaboration state
interface ProjectCollaboration {
  projectId: string;
  activeUsers: UserPresence[];
  currentActivity: {
    userId: string;
    action: string;
    startedAt: Date;
  }[];
  sharedLogs: boolean;
  conflictWarnings: ProjectConflict[];
}
```

### WebSocket Server Implementation
```typescript
class CollaborationWebSocketServer {
  private io: SocketIO.Server;
  private teamRooms: Map<string, Set<string>> = new Map();
  private userPresence: Map<string, UserPresence> = new Map();

  constructor(server: http.Server) {
    this.io = new SocketIO.Server(server, {
      cors: {
        origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || ['http://localhost:2602'],
        credentials: true
      }
    });

    this.setupEventHandlers();
  }

  setupEventHandlers() {
    this.io.use(this.authenticationMiddleware.bind(this));
    
    this.io.on('connection', (socket: Socket) => {
      console.log(`User ${socket.userId} connected`);
      
      socket.on('join_team', this.handleJoinTeam.bind(this, socket));
      socket.on('update_presence', this.handleUpdatePresence.bind(this, socket));
      socket.on('project_activity', this.handleProjectActivity.bind(this, socket));
      socket.on('chat_message', this.handleChatMessage.bind(this, socket));
      socket.on('disconnect', this.handleDisconnect.bind(this, socket));
    });
  }

  async handleJoinTeam(socket: Socket, teamId: string) {
    // Verify user is team member
    const isMember = await this.verifyTeamMembership(socket.userId, teamId);
    if (!isMember) {
      socket.emit('error', { message: 'Access denied to team' });
      return;
    }

    // Add to team room
    socket.join(`team:${teamId}`);
    
    if (!this.teamRooms.has(teamId)) {
      this.teamRooms.set(teamId, new Set());
    }
    this.teamRooms.get(teamId).add(socket.userId);

    // Update presence
    this.updateUserPresence(socket.userId, 'online', socket.id);
    
    // Broadcast join event
    socket.to(`team:${teamId}`).emit('user_joined', {
      userId: socket.userId,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });

    // Send current team state
    await this.sendTeamState(socket, teamId);
  }

  async handleProjectActivity(socket: Socket, activity: ProjectActivity) {
    const teams = await this.getUserTeams(socket.userId);
    
    for (const teamId of teams) {
      socket.to(`team:${teamId}`).emit('project_activity', {
        type: 'project_activity',
        teamId,
        userId: socket.userId,
        timestamp: new Date(),
        data: activity
      });
    }

    // Store activity for history
    await this.storeActivityEvent(socket.userId, activity);
  }
}
```

    </div>
  );
};

const ActivityFeed: React.FC<{ activities: Activity[] }> = ({ activities }) => {
  return (
    <div className="activity-feed">
      <h3>Team Activity</h3>
      <div className="activity-list">
        {activities.map(activity => (
          <ActivityItem 
            key={activity.id} 
            activity={activity}
            timestamp={activity.timestamp}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
