# Epic 4: Authentication & Security Framework

**Epic ID**: EPIC-4  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint Target**: Sprint 5  
**Estimated Points**: 55 story points  
**Created**: August 8, 2025  

## Epic Summary

Implement comprehensive authentication and security framework for the MCP Debug Host Platform to enable secure multi-user access, role-based permissions, and enterprise-ready security controls.

## Business Value

- **Security**: Protect development environments from unauthorized access
- **Compliance**: Meet enterprise security requirements for development platforms
- **Scalability**: Enable multi-user deployment scenarios
- **Trust**: Build confidence for production-adjacent usage

## Key Stakeholders

- **Security Teams**: Enterprise security compliance
- **Development Teams**: Secure collaboration requirements  
- **Platform Administrators**: User management and access control
- **Enterprise Users**: SSO and identity provider integration

## User Personas

1. **Platform Administrator**: Manages users, roles, and security policies
2. **Development Team Lead**: Configures team access and permissions
3. **Developer**: Accesses secure development environment
4. **Security Auditor**: Reviews access logs and security compliance

## Success Criteria

- [ ] JWT-based authentication with configurable token expiry
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- [ ] Session management with secure logout and timeout
- [ ] API key management for headless/CI environments
- [ ] Audit logging for all security-relevant events
- [ ] Integration with external identity providers (OAuth2/SAML)

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication Methods
- JWT tokens with RS256 signing
- API keys for programmatic access
- OAuth2 integration (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
- SAML 2.0 support for enterprise SSO

### Security Features
- Secure session management
- Rate limiting and brute force protection
- Password policies and secure storage (bcrypt)
- Two-factor authentication (TOTP)
- Account lockout mechanisms

### Authorization Framework
- Role-based access control (Admin, Lead, Developer, Viewer)
- Resource-level permissions (project access, container controls)
- Team-based workspace isolation
- API endpoint authorization middleware

## Stories Breakdown

### Sprint 5 Stories (55 points total)

1. **Story 5.1**: JWT Authentication Service (13 points)
2. **Story 5.2**: User Registration & Password Management (8 points)  
3. **Story 5.3**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Foundation (13 points)
4. **Story 5.4**: Session Management & Security Middleware (8 points)
5. **Story 5.5**: API Key Authentication System (8 points)
6. **Story 5.6**: Security Audit Logging (5 points)

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Phase 3 UI foundation (Stories 3.1-3.4) - **REQUIRED**
- Database schema design for user management
- Security policy definition

### External Dependencies  
- JWT library selection and security review
- Password hashing library (bcrypt/argon2)
- OAuth2 client libraries
- Session storage solution (Redis recommended)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Security vulnerabilities in authentication implementation
- Performance impact of authorization middleware
- Complex OAuth2 integration edge cases

### Medium Risk
- Session storage scalability
- Password policy enforcement complexity
- Role permission matrix complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
- Security code review by external experts
- Comprehensive security testing suite
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Performance benchmarking at each milestone

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All authentication methods working securely
- [ ] RBAC system enforcing permissions correctly
- [ ] Security audit logging capturing all events
- [ ] Performance impact <50ms per request
- [ ] Security penetration testing passed
- [ ] Documentation complete with security guidelines
