# Epic 5: Multi-User Support & Workspace Management

**Epic ID**: EPIC-5  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint Target**: Sprint 6  
**Estimated Points**: 47 story points  
**Created**: August 8, 2025  

## Epic Summary

Transform the MCP Debug Host Platform from single-user to multi-user architecture with isolated workspaces, team collaboration features, and scalable resource management.

## Business Value

- **Team Collaboration**: Enable multiple developers to work simultaneously
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize resource allocation across users
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Support organization-scale development teams
- **Productivity**: Reduce environment conflicts and setup time

## Key Stakeholders

- **Development Teams**: Collaborative development environment
- **Team Leads**: Team resource management and oversight
- **Platform Administrators**: Multi-tenant system management
- **Enterprise IT**: Scalable development platform deployment

## User Personas

1. **Team Lead**: Manages team workspaces and resource allocation
2. **Developer**: Works in isolated workspace with team collaboration
3. **Platform Administrator**: Oversees multi-user system and resources
4. **Guest User**: Limited access for contractors or temporary access

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Isolated user workspaces with secure boundaries
- [ ] Team-based project sharing and collaboration
- [ ] Resource quotas and usage monitoring per user/team
- [ ] Real-time collaboration features (shared logs, status)
- [ ] Workspace templates for consistent team environments
- [ ] Performance scaling to 50+ concurrent users

## Technical Requirements

### Workspace Isolation
- User-specific Docker networks and containers
- Filesystem isolation with secure mount points
- Port allocation per user with conflict prevention
- Process isolation and resource limits

### Collaboration Features
- Project sharing between team members
- Real-time status updates and notifications
- Shared log viewing with permissions
- Team chat integration (webhook support)

### Resource Management
- Per-user resource quotas (CPU, memory, storage)
- Team-level resource pooling and allocation
- Usage monitoring and reporting
- Fair scheduling and resource balancing

## Stories Breakdown

### Sprint 6 Stories (47 points total)

1. **Story 6.1**: User Workspace Isolation Architecture (13 points)
2. **Story 6.2**: Team Management & Project Sharing (8 points)
3. **Story 6.3**: Resource Quotas & Usage Monitoring (8 points)
4. **Story 6.4**: Real-time Collaboration Dashboard (13 points) 
5. **Story 6.5**: Multi-user Port Management (5 points)

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Epic 4 (Authentication Framework) - **REQUIRED**
- Database schema for user/team management
- Enhanced container orchestration system

### External Dependencies
- Redis for real-time collaboration state
- Message queue system (RabbitMQ/Redis Pub/Sub)
- Enhanced monitoring infrastructure

## Architecture Changes

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Users and Teams
CREATE TABLE teams (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  resource_quota JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE team_members (
  team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'member',
  joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Workspace Management
CREATE TABLE user_workspaces (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  name VARCHAR(100),
  network_id VARCHAR(64),
  resource_limits JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Resource Quota System
```json
{
  "user_quotas": {
    "max_projects": 10,
    "max_cpu_cores": 4,
    "max_memory_gb": 8,
    "max_storage_gb": 50,
    "max_concurrent_containers": 5
  },
  "team_quotas": {
    "max_projects": 100,
    "max_cpu_cores": 32,
    "max_memory_gb": 64,
    "max_storage_gb": 500,
    "shared_resources": true
  }
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Resource contention between users
- Security boundaries in shared infrastructure
- Performance degradation with concurrent users

### Medium Risk
- Complex permission matrix for team sharing
- Real-time collaboration scaling challenges
- Migration complexity from single-user

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive load testing with concurrent users
- Security audit of isolation boundaries
- Gradual feature rollout with monitoring
- Fallback to single-user mode in emergencies

## Performance Requirements

### Scalability Targets
- Support 50+ concurrent active users
- <200ms response time for multi-user operations
- <5% performance degradation per additional user
- Real-time updates <1 second latency

### Resource Efficiency
- Shared base images to reduce storage overhead
- Intelligent container scheduling and pooling
- Resource cleanup for inactive users
- Efficient networking with minimal overhead

## Definition of Done

- [ ] 50+ concurrent users supported without degradation
- [ ] Complete workspace isolation verified
- [ ] Team collaboration features fully functional
- [ ] Resource quotas enforced and monitored
- [ ] Real-time updates working reliably
- [ ] Security boundaries tested and validated
