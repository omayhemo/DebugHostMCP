## 📊 Capacity Validation Results

### Velocity Alignment ✅ PASSED
- **Sprint 1 Baseline**: 21 story points delivered (100% success rate)
- **Sprint 2 Target**: 21 story points planned
- **Variance**: 0 points (exact capacity match)
- **Confidence Level**: HIGH - proven team velocity maintained

### Team Availability ✅ PASSED
- **Developer Agent**: Full-time availability confirmed
- **Parallel Execution**: 4-story concurrent development capability validated in Sprint 1
- **SM Coordination**: Daily monitoring and facilitation support available
- **Resource Constraints**: None identified

### Story Point Distribution ✅ PASSED
```
Story 2.1: 8 points (38%) - Complex integration work
Story 2.2: 5 points (24%) - Moderate Docker integration  
Story 2.3: 5 points (24%) - Moderate streaming/storage
Story 2.4: 3 points (14%) - Low complexity framework work
Total: 21 points (100%)
```

**Assessment**: Balanced complexity distribution, no single story dominates sprint capacity.

## 🔗 Dependency Validation Results

### Foundation Dependencies ✅ SATISFIED
- **Story 1.1**: Docker Base Images (✅ Complete)
- **Story 1.2**: MCP HTTP Server with SSE (✅ Complete) 
- **Story 1.3**: Docker Manager Module (✅ Complete)
- **Story 1.4**: Port Registry System (✅ Complete)

### Inter-Sprint Dependencies ✅ VALIDATED
```
Story 2.1 (Registration) 
├── Requires: Port Registry (✅), Docker Manager (✅)
├── Enables: Story 2.2 (Container Lifecycle)
└── Risk: LOW - all prereqs satisfied

Story 2.2 (Container Lifecycle)
├── Requires: Story 2.1 (Registration), Docker Manager (✅)
├── Enables: Story 2.3 (Log Management)
└── Risk: LOW - clear dependency path

Story 2.3 (Log Management)  
├── Requires: Story 2.2 (Lifecycle), SSE Infrastructure (✅)
├── Enables: Complete monitoring stack
└── Risk: LOW - sequential execution planned

Story 2.4 (Error Handling)
├── Requires: Stories 2.1-2.3 (for integration)
├── Cross-cutting: All system components
└── Risk: LOW - can develop in parallel
```

### Critical Path Analysis ✅ OPTIMIZED
**Primary Path**: 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 (16 points, 76% of sprint)
**Parallel Path**: 2.4 (3 points, 24% of sprint, cross-cutting integration)

**Execution Strategy**: 
- Phase 1: Start 2.1 + 2.4 in parallel
- Phase 2: Complete 2.1, start 2.2, continue 2.4
- Phase 3: Complete 2.2, start 2.3, integrate 2.4
- Phase 4: Complete 2.3, finalize 2.4 integration

## 🎯 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Story 2.1**: Multi-tech stack detection complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Start with core patterns, extend iteratively
   - **Fallback**: Manual tech stack specification

2. **Story 2.2**: Docker integration edge cases  
   - **Mitigation**: Leverage existing Docker Manager foundation
   - **Fallback**: Basic start/stop operations first

3. **Story 2.3**: Real-time streaming performance
   - **Mitigation**: Build on proven SSE infrastructure
   - **Fallback**: Polling-based log updates

### Low Risk Items ✅
- **Story 2.4**: Well-established error handling patterns
- **Foundation**: All Phase 1 components stable and tested
- **Team Capability**: Proven parallel development execution
