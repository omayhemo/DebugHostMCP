## Definition of Done

All stories must meet these criteria for completion:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code written and functioning
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing (where applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed (self-review for single developer)

## Notes

- Phase 1 focuses on foundational infrastructure without which no other components can function
- Each phase builds upon the previous phase's deliverables
- Stories are sized using Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- Complex stories (8+ points) should be considered for breakdown
