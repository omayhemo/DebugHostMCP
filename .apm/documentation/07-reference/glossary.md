## üèóÔ∏è Core APM Concepts

### **A**

**Agent**
A software entity that acts autonomously to perform tasks. In APM, agents are implemented as persona-specific AI assistants that handle different aspects of software development.

**Agentic Persona Mapping (APM)**
A framework that maps distinct AI personas to specific roles in software development teams, enabling specialized and coordinated development workflows.

**AP Orchestrator**
The central coordination agent that manages persona activation, task delegation, and workflow orchestration. Activated via `/ap` or `/ap_orchestrator` commands.

**APM Root (`/mnt/c/Code/MCPServers/DebugHostMCP/.apm`)**
The base directory containing all APM framework files, typically located at `/mnt/c/Code/MCPServers/DebugHostMCP/.apm`.

**Acceptance Criteria**
Specific conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete. APM agents automatically track and update acceptance criteria progress in the backlog.

**Activation Command**
A slash command (e.g., `/developer`, `/qa`, `/architect`) that activates a specific persona and transitions Claude into that role.

**Archiving**
The process of moving completed session notes from the active directory to the archive directory for long-term storage and organization.

### **B**

**Backlog Management**
The systematic tracking and updating of user stories, epics, and tasks in `backlog.md`. All APM personas are required to update the backlog when completing work.

**Build Distribution**
The process of generating APM installation packages from source templates and configurations, handled by `build-distribution.sh`.

### **C**

**Claude Code**
Anthropic's CLI tool that APM integrates with, providing the underlying command execution and file management capabilities.

**Coordination**
The process by which multiple parallel agents communicate and synchronize their work to avoid conflicts and ensure coherent outcomes.

**Command Pipeline**
The sequence of operations executed when an APM command is invoked, including session management, voice notifications, and persona activation.

## üë• Persona System

### **D**

**Design Architect**
An APM persona specializing in user interface design, user experience architecture, and design system creation. Activated with `/design-architect`.

**Developer Agent**
An APM persona focused on code implementation, testing, and technical documentation. Activated with `/developer` or `/dev`.

**Dynamic Persona Switching**
The ability to transition between different persona types during a session without losing context, using commands like `/handoff` and `/switch`.

### **E**

**Epic**
A large user story or feature that spans multiple sprints and contains multiple smaller user stories. APM tracks epic progress and completion percentages.

### **H**

**Handoff**
A direct transition from one persona to another without session compaction, preserving full context. Executed via the `/handoff` command.

### **P**

**Persona**
A specialized AI role with specific capabilities, responsibilities, and behavioral patterns. APM includes 9 core personas: Orchestrator, Analyst, Architect, Developer, PM, PO, QA, SM, and Design Architect.

**Persona Activation**
The process of transforming Claude into a specific persona role, including loading relevant context, activating voice notifications, and applying behavioral rules.

**Persona Capability**
A specific skill or function that a persona can perform, such as "code_implementation" for developers or "test_planning" for QA.

**Product Manager (PM)**
An APM persona responsible for project planning, resource management, risk assessment, and timeline coordination. Activated with `/pm`.

**Product Owner (PO)**
An APM persona handling backlog management, priority setting, stakeholder communication, and product vision. Activated with `/po`.

### **Q**

**QA Agent**
An APM persona specializing in test planning, test execution, defect management, and quality metrics. Activated with `/qa`.

### **S**

**Scrum Master (SM)**
An APM persona focused on ceremony facilitation, impediment removal, team coaching, and process improvement. Activated with `/sm`.

**System Architect**
An APM persona handling system design, technical specifications, architecture documentation, and technology recommendations. Activated with `/architect`.
