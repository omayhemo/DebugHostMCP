# APM Persona System Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for the Agentic Persona Mapping (APM) framework's persona system. This directory contains detailed guides for each specialized agent persona.

## 🎯 Persona System Overview

The APM v4.0.0 framework includes 9 specialized agent personas, each designed for specific aspects of software development and project management. These agents work together through a unified orchestration system to provide comprehensive project support.

### 🚀 Native Sub-Agent Architecture

All personas in APM v4.0.0 have been modernized with:
- **4-8x Performance Improvement**: Native sub-agent execution
- **Zero CLI Crashes**: Rock-solid integration with Claude Code
- **True Parallelism**: Concurrent execution with intelligent coordination
- **Unified Persona System**: Single source of truth definitions

## 🎪 Workflow Patterns

### 🚀 Typical Project Flow
```
1. ap (Initialize) → 2. /analyst (Research) → 3. /pm (Requirements)
   ↓
4. /architect (Design) → 5. /design-architect (UI/UX) → 6. /po (Backlog)
   ↓
7. /sm (Stories) → 8. /dev (Implementation) → 9. /qa (Testing)
```

### ⚡ Rapid Prototype Flow
```
/analyst → /design-architect → /dev (parallel implementation)
```

### 🔄 Iterative Enhancement Flow
```
/qa (identify issues) → /dev (fixes) → /qa (validation) → repeat
```

### 📊 Comprehensive Planning Flow
```
/parallel-brainstorming + /parallel-prd + /parallel-architecture
     ↓
/parallel-stories + /parallel-qa-framework
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. **Always Start with Orchestrator**
- Use `ap` to initialize and get project guidance
- Orchestrator provides context and workflow recommendations

### 2. **Follow Natural Progression**
- Research → Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing
- Each phase builds on the previous one

### 3. **Leverage Specialization**
- Use each persona for their core expertise
- Don't ask a Developer to write requirements

### 4. **Utilize Parallel Execution**
- Use parallel commands for 3-4x performance improvements
- Especially valuable for comprehensive documentation and analysis

### 5. **Maintain Context Continuity**
- Personas automatically share session notes
- Use `/handoff` for clean transitions between agents

### 6. **Trust the Evidence-Based Approach**
- All personas follow "Never Guess, Always Verify" protocols
- Expect thorough research and documentation

## 🔍 Choosing the Right Persona

### 🧠 For Strategic Work
- **Complex planning**: Use Orchestrator for coordination
- **Market research**: Analyst for comprehensive analysis
- **Product strategy**: PM for strategic direction

### 🎨 For Creative Work
- **UI/UX design**: Design Architect for user experience
- **System architecture**: System Architect for technical design
- **Problem solving**: Analyst for creative brainstorming

### 📋 For Operational Work
- **Backlog grooming**: Product Owner for prioritization
- **Story creation**: Scrum Master for user stories
- **Process optimization**: Scrum Master for workflow improvement

### 💻 For Technical Work
- **Code implementation**: Developer for programming
- **Testing strategies**: QA Engineer for quality assurance
- **Technical debugging**: Developer for problem resolution

## 🚨 Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Wrong Persona Selection
- Don't use Developer for requirements gathering → Use Analyst or PM
- Don't use QA for architecture design → Use System Architect
- Don't use PM for code implementation → Use Developer

### ❌ Sequential When Parallel Would Help
- Don't run sequential analysis when you need comprehensive coverage
- Use parallel commands for batch processing and faster results

### ❌ Context Loss
- Don't repeat information between personas
- Trust the session management system

### ❌ Skipping Research Phase
- Don't jump straight to implementation
- Always start with proper analysis and requirements
