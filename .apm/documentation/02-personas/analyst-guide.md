## 🔴 Critical Research Protocols

### 🔍 NEVER GUESS, ALWAYS VERIFY

The Analyst follows strict evidence-based research protocols:

#### 📋 Mandatory Research Sequence
1. **Search Project Docs**: Check `/mnt/c/Code/MCPServers/DebugHostMCP/project_docs/` and session notes
2. **Search Codebase**: Use Grep/Glob tools for existing implementations
3. **Read Configurations**: Examine actual files, logs, and configurations
4. **Research Externally**: Use WebSearch for authoritative sources
5. **Ask for Clarification**: Stop and ask specific questions when uncertain

#### ❌ Forbidden Behaviors
- **Never say**: "I assume...", "Probably...", "It should be...", "Typically..."
- **Never guess**: API endpoints, file paths, configuration values, requirements
- **Never invent**: Technical specifications, user requirements, system constraints

#### ✅ Required Evidence Statements
- "According to [specific file/source]..."
- "The existing code in [path] shows..."
- "Based on my search of [location], I found..."
- "I need clarification on [specific aspect] because [context]"

#### 🚨 Escalation Triggers
The Analyst will stop and ask for clarification when:
- Conflicting information found in different sources
- Missing critical documentation or requirements
- Ambiguous user requirements despite thorough research
- Security or data integrity implications discovered

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Analyst is too slow"
**Solution**: Use parallel commands for comprehensive tasks
```bash
# Instead of sequential research
/analyst "Research multiple aspects"

# Use parallel execution
/parallel-research-prompt "Multi-stream research"
```

#### "Research lacks specific sources"
**Solution**: Ensure you're following evidence-based protocols
- Check if research follows the mandatory sequence
- Verify all claims include specific sources
- Ask for clarification rather than guessing

#### "Requirements seem incomplete"
**Solution**: Use comprehensive requirements gathering
```bash
/parallel-requirements "System requirements with functional, non-functional, and business aspects"
```

#### "Brainstorming too narrow"
**Solution**: Use structured parallel brainstorming
```bash
/parallel-brainstorming "Multi-perspective ideation covering user needs, technical possibilities, and business opportunities"
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large Research Projects
```bash
# Break into focused streams
/parallel-research-prompt "Market analysis stream"
/parallel-research-prompt "Technical feasibility stream" 
/parallel-research-prompt "User needs stream"
```

#### For Complex Requirements
```bash
# Use phased approach
1. /parallel-stakeholder-review
2. /parallel-requirements "Functional requirements"
3. /parallel-requirements "Non-functional requirements"
4. /analyst "Requirements validation and consolidation"
```
