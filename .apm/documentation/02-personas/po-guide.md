## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Stories are too large for sprints"
**Solution**: Use better story decomposition and sizing
```bash
# Story breakdown focus
/parallel-stories "Break down large features into sprint-sized user stories (< 13 story points each)"

# Include sizing guidance
/po "Create user stories with proper sizing guidance and decomposition principles"
```

#### "Acceptance criteria unclear"
**Solution**: Use comprehensive acceptance criteria generation
```bash
# Detailed acceptance criteria
/parallel-acceptance-criteria "Create comprehensive acceptance criteria with Given-When-Then scenarios for all user stories"

# Include business rules
/parallel-acceptance-criteria "Generate acceptance criteria including business rules, edge cases, and error handling"
```

#### "Backlog priorities unclear"
**Solution**: Use systematic prioritization approaches
```bash
# Multi-criteria prioritization
/parallel-prioritization "Prioritize backlog using business value, user impact, technical risk, and dependency analysis"

# Include stakeholder input
/parallel-prioritization "Stakeholder-aligned prioritization with clear rationale for all decisions"
```

#### "Sprint planning ineffective"
**Solution**: Focus on capacity-based planning with better grooming
```bash
# Capacity-focused planning
/po "Plan sprints with detailed team capacity analysis and velocity-based story selection"

# Ensure story readiness
/parallel-validation "Validate all sprint stories meet Definition of Ready criteria"
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large PRDs
```bash
# Phased epic creation
/parallel-epic "Create Phase 1 epics for immediate development"
/parallel-epic "Create Phase 2 epics for future sprints"
/parallel-stories "Generate stories for Phase 1 epics only"
```

#### For Complex Backlogs
```bash
# Modular backlog management
/parallel-prioritization "Prioritize by feature area or epic theme"
/parallel-validation "Validate story readiness by epic or sprint"
```
