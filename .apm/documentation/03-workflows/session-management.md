# Session Management - Context Continuity & Knowledge Preservation

## Overview

Effective session management is crucial for maintaining context, preserving work progress, and ensuring seamless collaboration across personas and time. This workflow ensures no information is lost and every session builds upon previous work.

## üß† Session Management Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Continuous Documentation**: Every significant action is documented in real-time
2. **Context Preservation**: Work context is maintained across sessions and persona transitions
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Information flows seamlessly between personas and team members
4. **Progress Tracking**: All work progress is visible and trackable
5. **Recovery Capability**: Ability to resume work from any point without information loss

### Session Types
- **Work Sessions**: Active development, analysis, or planning work
- **Handoff Sessions**: Transitions between personas or team members
- **Review Sessions**: Progress review, stakeholder updates, quality assurance
- **Planning Sessions**: Sprint planning, architecture design, strategy sessions

## üìã Session Note Structure & Standards

### Standard Session Note Format
```markdown
# Session: [Descriptive Title]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Persona: [Active Persona/Role]
Session Type: [Work/Handoff/Review/Planning]

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Primary objective 1
- [ ] Primary objective 2
- [ ] Primary objective 3

## Context from Previous Session
[Brief summary of relevant context from previous work]

## Work Progress

```

### Session Note Naming Convention
**Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-[Persona]-[Brief-Description].md`

**Examples**:
- `2025-08-10-09-30-00-Developer-UserAuth-Implementation.md`
- `2025-08-10-14-15-00-Architect-Database-Schema-Design.md`  
- `2025-08-10-16-45-00-QA-Test-Framework-Setup.md`

## üîÑ Session Lifecycle Management

### 1. Session Initialization
**Every session must begin with:**
1. **Context Check**: Read latest session notes for relevant context
2. **Session Note Creation**: Create new session note with current timestamp
3. **Objective Setting**: Define clear objectives for the session
4. **Previous Work Review**: Understand what was accomplished previously

**APM Session Initialization Pattern:**
```bash
# 1. Check for existing session context
LS /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes/

# 2. Read latest relevant session note (if exists)
Read [latest-session-file]

# 3. Create new session note
Write /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes/[timestamp-description].md

# 4. Use voice notification for session start
bash /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speak[Persona].sh "Starting new session..."
```

### 2. Continuous Documentation During Session
**Document in real-time when:**
- ‚úÖ Starting work on a new task or component
- ‚úÖ Completing significant work or reaching milestones
- ‚úÖ Making important decisions or architectural choices
- ‚úÖ Encountering and resolving issues or blockers
- ‚úÖ Every 15-20 minutes during active work (progress checkpoints)
- ‚úÖ Modifying key files like backlog.md, requirements.md, etc.
- ‚úÖ Before switching contexts or taking breaks

**Documentation Update Pattern:**
```markdown
### [10:30] - Started User Authentication Implementation
- Status: In Progress
- Approach: Using JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- Files: Created `auth.js`, `user-model.js`, `auth-middleware.js`
- Decision: Using bcrypt for password hashing (industry standard)

### [11:15] - Progress Checkpoint
- Status: 60% complete
- Completed: User model, password hashing, basic JWT creation
- Next: Token validation middleware and refresh token logic
- Issues: None currently

### [12:00] - Authentication Module Completed
- Status: Completed
- Files Modified: auth.js, user-model.js, auth-middleware.js, tests/auth.test.js
- Testing: All unit tests passing
- Integration: Ready for integration testing
```

### 3. Session Transitions & Handoffs
**When switching personas or ending sessions:**
1. **Complete Current Work Documentation**: Ensure all recent work is documented
2. **Update Project Artifacts**: Ensure backlog.md and other key files are current
3. **Handoff Summary**: Create clear summary for next session/persona
4. **Context Preservation**: Document current state and immediate next steps

**Handoff Documentation Pattern:**
```markdown
## Handoff to [Next Persona/Session]
### Current State
- Authentication module implementation: 90% complete
- Remaining work: Integration testing and error handling
- All unit tests passing, ready for system testing

### Immediate Next Steps for [Next Persona]
1. Run integration tests with authentication module
2. Implement error handling for authentication failures  
3. Update API documentation with authentication endpoints

### Context to Preserve
- JWT token expiration set to 15 minutes (security requirement)
- Refresh token rotation implemented per OWASP guidelines
- Database schema includes user roles for future authorization

### Files to Focus On
- `/src/auth/auth.js` - Main authentication logic
- `/tests/auth.test.js` - Unit tests (all passing)
- `/docs/api.md` - Needs update with auth endpoints
```

### 4. Session Archiving
**When to Archive:**
- Session is complete and documented
- All handoff information is captured
- No immediate follow-up work planned
- Session represents a logical completion point

**Archiving Process:**
1. **Final Review**: Ensure session note is complete and accurate
2. **Move to Archive**: Move to `/session_notes/archive/` directory
3. **Create Archive Summary**: Brief summary of session outcomes
4. **Update Session Index**: Maintain searchable index of archived sessions

## üéØ Context Preservation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Layered Context Architecture
**Context Layers:**
1. **Immediate Context**: Current session work and decisions
2. **Project Context**: Overall project status and long-term decisions  
3. **Historical Context**: Previous sessions and lessons learned
4. **Environmental Context**: Technical constraints and dependencies

### Strategy 2: Smart Context Retrieval
**Context Retrieval Process:**
1. **Latest Session Review**: Always check most recent session notes
2. **Related Work Search**: Find sessions with related work or decisions
3. **Issue History**: Review previous solutions to similar problems
4. **Decision History**: Understand rationale behind past architectural choices

### Strategy 3: Proactive Context Documentation
**Context Documentation Points:**
- **Decision Rationale**: Why decisions were made, not just what was decided
- **Alternative Options**: What other approaches were considered
- **Environmental Factors**: Technical, business, or resource constraints that influenced decisions
- **Success Criteria**: How to measure if decisions/implementations are successful

## üîÑ Multi-Session Workflows

### Pattern 1: Progressive Feature Development
**Session 1**: Requirements analysis and architecture design
**Session 2**: Core implementation and unit testing
**Session 3**: Integration testing and bug fixes
**Session 4**: User acceptance testing and documentation

**Context Flow:**
- Session 1 ‚Üí Session 2: Architecture decisions and implementation plan
- Session 2 ‚Üí Session 3: Implementation details and known issues
- Session 3 ‚Üí Session 4: Test results and remaining work

### Pattern 2: Cross-Persona Collaboration
**Developer Session**: Implement core functionality
**QA Session**: Create test framework and execute tests
**Architect Session**: Review implementation against architecture
**Product Session**: Validate against business requirements

**Context Handoffs:**
- Developer ‚Üí QA: Implementation details and test scenarios
- QA ‚Üí Architect: Test results and architectural concerns
- Architect ‚Üí Product: Technical recommendations and trade-offs
- Product ‚Üí Developer: Requirements clarification and priorities

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement
**Analysis Session**: Problem analysis and solution options
**Implementation Session**: Initial implementation attempt
**Review Session**: Review results and identify improvements
**Refinement Session**: Implement improvements and finalize
