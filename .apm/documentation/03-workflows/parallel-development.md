- **Don't Skip Handoff Documentation**: Document work for future sessions

## 🎯 Parallel Development Decision Tree

### Step 1: Assess Work Complexity
```
Is this work:
├── Simple (< 2 hours, single component) → Use sequential development
├── Medium (2-6 hours, 2-3 components) → Consider parallel development  
└── Complex (> 6 hours, 3+ components) → Use parallel development
```

### Step 2: Evaluate Dependencies
```
Are components:
├── Highly Dependent → Sequential development (with parallel testing)
├── Moderately Dependent → Parallel with frequent integration points
└── Independent → Full parallel development
```

### Step 3: Check Team Capacity
```
Team capacity:
├── Limited (1-2 developers) → Sequential with parallel QA
├── Moderate (3-4 developers) → 2-3 parallel streams
└── High (5+ developers) → 3-4 parallel streams
```

### Step 4: Select Parallel Pattern
```
Choose pattern based on:
├── Feature Work → /parallel-stories or /parallel-sprint
├── Architecture Work → /parallel-architecture  
├── Testing Work → /parallel-test-plan or /parallel-validation
├── Infrastructure Work → /parallel-automation-plan
└── Problem Solving → /parallel-course-correction
```
