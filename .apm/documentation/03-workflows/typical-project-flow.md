#### 1.2 Architecture & Design Planning
```
/architect → System design → /design-architect → UI/UX design
```

**Process:**
1. **System Architecture**: `/architect` for technical design
2. **Design Architecture**: `/design-architect` for user experience
3. **Architecture Review**: `/parallel-architecture` for comprehensive validation
4. **Technology Stack**: Finalize frameworks, databases, deployment strategy

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ System architecture diagrams
- ✅ Database schema design
- ✅ API specifications
- ✅ UI/UX wireframes and prototypes
- ✅ Technology decision log

#### 1.3 Project Planning & Estimation
```
/pm → Project planning → /po → Backlog creation → Sprint planning
```

**Process:**
1. **Project Management**: `/pm` for timeline and resource planning
2. **Product Ownership**: `/po` for backlog creation and prioritization
3. **Sprint Planning**: Break down features into manageable sprints
4. **Capacity Planning**: Allocate resources and set realistic timelines

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Project timeline with milestones
- ✅ Product backlog with user stories
- ✅ Sprint plans with story assignments
- ✅ Resource allocation matrix

### Phase 2: Development Execution

#### 2.1 Sprint Setup & Story Grooming
```
/po → Backlog grooming → /groom → Story refinement
```

**Weekly Process:**
1. **Backlog Grooming**: `/groom` for story refinement
2. **Story Estimation**: Size stories with story points
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear completion criteria
4. **Sprint Planning**: Assign stories to sprints based on capacity

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All stories have clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Story points are validated and agreed upon
- ✅ Sprint capacity matches team velocity
- ✅ Dependencies are identified and managed

#### 2.2 Parallel Development Execution
```
/parallel-sprint → Multiple dev streams → /parallel-test-plan → Quality assurance
```

**High-Performance Development:**
1. **Parallel Sprint Launch**: `/parallel-sprint` for 4-6x speedup
2. **Multiple Dev Streams**: Frontend, Backend, Database work in parallel
3. **Continuous Integration**: Regular code integration and testing
4. **Quality Gates**: Automated testing at each integration point

**Performance Targets:**
- 🚀 **4-6x Development Speedup** with parallel execution
- 🚀 **Zero Integration Conflicts** with intelligent dependency management
- 🚀 **Continuous Quality** with parallel testing streams

#### 2.3 Quality Assurance & Testing
```
/qa-framework → Comprehensive testing → /qa-predict → Risk assessment
```

**QA Process:**
1. **Test Framework**: `/qa-framework` for comprehensive test coverage
2. **Predictive Testing**: `/qa-predict` for ML-powered test optimization
3. **Security Testing**: `/security-scan` for vulnerability assessment
4. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and optimization

**Quality Metrics:**
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage
- ✅ Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ All acceptance criteria validated

### Phase 3: Integration & Deployment

#### 3.1 System Integration
```
/architect → Integration review → /parallel-validation → End-to-end testing
```

**Integration Process:**
1. **Integration Planning**: Coordinate component integration
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Full system validation
3. **Performance Validation**: System-wide performance testing
4. **Security Hardening**: Final security review and hardening

#### 3.2 Deployment Preparation
```
/dev → Deployment scripts → /qa → Pre-prod validation
```

**Deployment Process:**
1. **Deployment Automation**: Create automated deployment scripts
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure production and staging environments
3. **Data Migration**: Plan and execute database migrations
4. **Rollback Planning**: Prepare rollback procedures

#### 3.3 Go-Live & Monitoring
```
Production deployment → Monitoring setup → Support handoff
```

**Go-Live Checklist:**
- ✅ Production deployment successful
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting configured
- ✅ Support documentation complete
- ✅ User training materials ready

### Phase 4: Post-Launch Support & Iteration

#### 4.1 Production Support
```
/qa → Monitor issues → /dev → Bug fixes → /qa → Validation
```

**Support Process:**
1. **Issue Monitoring**: Track production issues and user feedback
2. **Bug Triage**: Prioritize and assign bug fixes
3. **Hotfix Deployment**: Rapid deployment for critical issues
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Ongoing performance optimization

#### 4.2 Continuous Improvement
```
/analyst → Usage analysis → /po → Feature planning → Next sprint
```

**Improvement Process:**
1. **Usage Analytics**: Analyze user behavior and feature adoption
2. **Feedback Collection**: Gather user and stakeholder feedback
3. **Feature Planning**: Plan next iteration based on learnings
4. **Process Optimization**: Refine development processes

## 🎯 Decision Points & Branching

### When to Use Parallel vs Sequential

**Use Parallel Development When:**
- ✅ Multiple independent components
- ✅ Tight delivery timelines
- ✅ Complex features with multiple acceptance criteria
- ✅ Team has capacity for parallel work

**Use Sequential Development When:**
- ✅ Simple, focused features
- ✅ Heavy dependencies between components
- ✅ Learning or prototype phase
- ✅ Limited development capacity

### Persona Selection Guidelines

**Project Phase → Primary Persona:**
- **Requirements**: Analyst + Product Owner
- **Architecture**: System Architect + Design Architect
- **Development**: Developer + QA (parallel)
- **Testing**: QA + Performance specialist
- **Deployment**: Developer + System Administrator
- **Support**: QA + Developer (on-call rotation)

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Requirements Drift
**Problem**: Requirements change during development
**Solution**: 
- Use `/stakeholder-review` at each sprint boundary
- Maintain traceability from requirements to code
- Regular `/analyst` reviews for requirement validation

### Pitfall 2: Integration Hell
**Problem**: Components don't integrate smoothly
**Solution**:
- Use `/parallel-validation` at each integration point
- Continuous integration with automated testing
- Regular `/architect` reviews for integration planning

### Pitfall 3: Technical Debt Accumulation
**Problem**: Code quality degrades over time
**Solution**:
- Regular `/qa-framework` reviews
- Code review processes in development workflow
- Dedicated technical debt sprints

### Pitfall 4: Communication Breakdown
**Problem**: Team members lose sync on project status
**Solution**:
- Continuous session note updates
- Regular backlog.md maintenance
- Use `/ap` for project coordination and status updates
