# Parallel Sprint Analysis Subtasks

## Task 1: Load Sprint Plan Analysis
**Objective**: Parse and understand the current sprint plan from the Product Owner
**Agent**: Scrum Master
**Output**: Structured sprint plan with story assignments

### Analysis Steps:
1. Read current backlog.md for active sprint stories (/mnt/c/Code/MCPServers/DebugHostMCP//backlog.md)
2. Identify stories marked for current sprint
3. Extract story priorities, points, and dependencies
4. Parse developer capacity and availability
5. Document sprint goals and success criteria

### Expected Output:
```markdown
# Sprint Plan Analysis
- Sprint Goal: [Main sprint objective]
- Total Story Points: [X points]
- Stories Count: [N stories]
- Estimated Duration: [X days]
- Key Dependencies: [List critical dependencies]
```

## Task 2: Analyze Story Dependencies
**Objective**: Map inter-story dependencies and integration points
**Agent**: Scrum Master  
**Output**: Dependency matrix and integration timeline

### Analysis Steps:
1. Review each story's acceptance criteria for external dependencies
2. Identify shared components, APIs, or data structures
3. Map story-to-story integration requirements
4. Determine critical path and parallel-safe stories
5. Create dependency resolution strategy

### Expected Output:
```markdown
# Story Dependencies Matrix
## Independent Stories (Parallel-Safe):
- Story A: [Can run in parallel with B, C]
- Story B: [Can run in parallel with A, C]

## Dependent Stories (Sequential Required):
- Story D: [Depends on Story A completion]
- Story E: [Requires Story B integration]

## Integration Points:
- API contracts between Story A and D
- Database schema changes in Story B affecting E
```

## Task 3: Developer Capacity Planning
**Objective**: Determine optimal developer agent allocation across stories
**Agent**: Scrum Master
**Output**: Developer assignment strategy with parallel streams

### Analysis Steps:
1. Calculate total development capacity available
2. Match story complexity with developer agent capabilities
3. Optimize for parallel execution while respecting dependencies
4. Plan integration points and handoff schedules
5. Define success criteria for each parallel stream

### Expected Output:
```markdown
# Developer Assignment Strategy
## Parallel Stream 1: Core Features
- Developer Agent Alpha: Story A (5 pts) + Story C (3 pts)
- Estimated Duration: 2 days
- Dependencies: None (can start immediately)

## Parallel Stream 2: Supporting Features  
- Developer Agent Beta: Story B (8 pts)
- Estimated Duration: 2.5 days
- Dependencies: None (can start immediately)

## Integration Stream:
- Developer Agent Gamma: Story D (5 pts) + Integration tasks
- Dependencies: Requires Stream 1 completion
- Start Delay: Day 2 (after Story A baseline)
```
