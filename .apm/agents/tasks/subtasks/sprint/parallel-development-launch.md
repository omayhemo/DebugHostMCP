# Parallel Development Launch Subtasks

## Task 4: Launch Primary Developer Stream
**Objective**: Start main feature development with highest priority stories
**Agent**: Developer Agent (Primary Stream)
**Output**: Active development on critical path stories

### Launch Parameters:
```markdown
# Primary Stream Configuration
Target Stories: [List of primary stories from sprint plan]
Priority Level: High (Critical path stories)
Dependencies: None (parallel-safe stories only)
Success Criteria: [Specific acceptance criteria from stories]
Integration Points: [List integration requirements]
```

### Developer Instructions:
1. Activate as Developer agent for Primary Stream
2. Load assigned stories from backlog.md (/mnt/c/Code/MCPServers/DebugHostMCP//backlog.md)
3. Begin implementation following story acceptance criteria
4. Document progress in real-time session notes ()
5. Flag any blocking issues immediately to Scrum Master
6. Coordinate with Integration Stream on API contracts

---

## Task 5: Launch Secondary Developer Stream  
**Objective**: Start parallel feature work on independent stories
**Agent**: Developer Agent (Secondary Stream)
**Output**: Active development on secondary priority stories

### Launch Parameters:
```markdown
# Secondary Stream Configuration
Target Stories: [List of secondary stories from sprint plan]
Priority Level: Medium (Supporting features)
Dependencies: None (verified parallel-safe)
Success Criteria: [Specific acceptance criteria from stories]
Coordination Points: [Cross-stream communication needs]
```

### Developer Instructions:
1. Activate as Developer agent for Secondary Stream
2. Load assigned stories from backlog.md (/mnt/c/Code/MCPServers/DebugHostMCP//backlog.md)
3. Implement features independently of Primary Stream
4. Maintain regular progress updates in session notes ()
5. Coordinate on shared components with Primary Stream
6. Prepare for integration testing phase

---

## Task 6: Launch Integration Developer
**Objective**: Handle cross-story integration and dependency resolution
**Agent**: Developer Agent (Integration Stream)
**Output**: Seamless integration between parallel development streams

### Launch Parameters:
```markdown
# Integration Stream Configuration
Target Stories: [Dependent stories requiring integration]
Dependencies: [Primary/Secondary stream deliverables]
Integration Points: [API contracts, shared components]
Success Criteria: [Integration test success, no conflicts]
Timeline: [Start after prerequisite stream completions]
```

### Integration Instructions:
1. Monitor Primary and Secondary stream progress
2. Begin integration work when prerequisites are met
3. Implement API contracts and shared component integration
4. Resolve merge conflicts and dependency issues
5. Coordinate integration testing with QA workflows
6. Ensure seamless integration of parallel work streams

---

## Task 7: Launch Testing Coordination
**Objective**: Coordinate testing across all parallel development streams
**Agent**: QA Agent (Parallel Testing)
**Output**: Comprehensive testing coverage across all parallel work

### Testing Coordination:
```markdown
# Parallel Testing Strategy
Stream Testing: Independent testing for each development stream
Integration Testing: Cross-stream functionality validation
Performance Testing: System performance under parallel changes
Regression Testing: Ensure existing functionality unaffected
```

### QA Instructions:
1. Activate as QA agent for parallel stream testing
2. Create test plans for each development stream
3. Execute tests in parallel with development work
4. Coordinate integration testing between streams
5. Report issues back to appropriate developer stream
6. Validate final integration meets all acceptance criteria

---

## Task 8: Monitor Parallel Progress
**Objective**: Track all development streams simultaneously for coordination
**Agent**: Scrum Master (Progress Monitor)
**Output**: Real-time sprint progress dashboard

### Monitoring Framework:
```markdown
# Progress Tracking Matrix
Primary Stream Progress: [% complete, current task, blockers]
Secondary Stream Progress: [% complete, current task, blockers]  
Integration Stream Progress: [% complete, dependencies met, timeline]
Testing Progress: [Tests passed/failed, coverage %, issues found]
Overall Sprint Health: [On track/at risk/blocked]
```

### Progress Monitoring:
1. Regular check-ins with all developer agents (every 4 hours)
2. Track story completion against sprint timeline
3. Identify and escalate blocking issues immediately
4. Coordinate resource reallocation if streams fall behind
5. Maintain sprint burndown across all parallel streams
6. Prepare daily progress summaries for stakeholders
