# Parallel Coordination & Synthesis Subtasks

## Task 9: Dependency Resolution Coordination
**Objective**: Coordinate handoffs and dependency resolution between development streams
**Agent**: Scrum Master (Dependency Coordinator)
**Output**: Seamless dependency resolution and stream handoffs

### Coordination Activities:
```markdown
# Dependency Resolution Framework
Stream Handoffs: [Primary → Integration, Secondary → Integration]
API Contract Validation: [Ensure contracts met between streams]
Shared Component Coordination: [Resolve conflicts, merge strategies]
Timeline Alignment: [Adjust stream timelines based on dependencies]
```

### Resolution Process:
1. Monitor dependency completion status across streams
2. Facilitate API contract discussions between developer agents
3. Resolve conflicts in shared component development
4. Adjust stream timelines when dependencies are delayed
5. Coordinate merge strategies for parallel work integration
6. Ensure no development stream is blocked by dependency issues

## Task 10: Integration Oversight Management
**Objective**: Ensure parallel work integrates correctly without conflicts
**Agent**: Scrum Master (Integration Overseer)
**Output**: Validated integration of all parallel development streams

### Integration Management:
```markdown
# Integration Oversight Framework
Code Integration: [Merge conflict resolution, branch management]
Feature Integration: [Cross-feature functionality validation]
Testing Integration: [Comprehensive integration test execution]
Performance Integration: [System performance validation]
```

### Integration Activities:
1. Review integration approach from Integration Developer stream
2. Validate API contracts are properly implemented
3. Ensure shared components work correctly across features
4. Coordinate integration testing with QA agent
5. Resolve any merge conflicts or integration issues
6. Validate system performance with all parallel changes

## Task 11: Progress Synthesis Aggregation
**Objective**: Aggregate progress from all developer agents into cohesive sprint status
**Agent**: Scrum Master (Progress Synthesizer)
**Output**: Comprehensive sprint progress report with all stream status

### Synthesis Framework:
```markdown
# Sprint Progress Synthesis
Individual Stream Progress: [Detailed status from each stream]
Overall Sprint Completion: [% complete against sprint goals]
Story Completion Status: [Stories done/in-progress/not-started]
Integration Health: [Integration success rate, conflicts resolved]
Sprint Velocity: [Points completed, velocity trend]
Risk Assessment: [Current risks, mitigation strategies]
```

### Synthesis Activities:
1. Collect detailed progress reports from all developer agents
2. Aggregate story completion status across all streams
3. Calculate overall sprint velocity and completion percentage
4. Assess integration health and success metrics
5. Identify and document current risks and mitigation strategies
6. Generate comprehensive sprint status for stakeholders

---

## Task 12: Sprint Health Assessment
**Objective**: Evaluate overall sprint progress and identify risks/opportunities
**Agent**: Scrum Master (Sprint Health Assessor)
**Output**: Sprint health dashboard with recommendations

### Health Assessment Framework:
```markdown
# Sprint Health Metrics
Velocity Trend: [Above/on/below target velocity]
Story Completion Rate: [Stories completed vs planned]
Integration Success: [% successful integrations, conflict rate]
Team Coordination: [Stream coordination effectiveness]
Risk Level: [Low/Medium/High with specific risks identified]
Recommendations: [Actions to improve sprint outcomes]
```

### Assessment Activities:
1. Analyze sprint velocity against historical performance
2. Evaluate story completion rate and quality metrics
3. Assess integration success rate and conflict resolution
4. Review team coordination effectiveness across streams
5. Identify current risks and their impact on sprint goals
6. Generate actionable recommendations for sprint improvement

### Final Sprint Report Template:
```markdown
