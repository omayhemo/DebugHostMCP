## ðŸš€ EXECUTION PROTOCOL

When user types `/parallel-stories`:

### Phase 1: Parallel Batch Story Analysis (7 Agents Simultaneously)

**CRITICAL**: Launch 7 native sub-agents in SINGLE response using natural language activation:

```markdown
I need to create multiple stories efficiently using parallel batch generation. Let me spawn 7 specialized agents working simultaneously across different story domains:

**Agent 1 - Epic Decomposition Specialist (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent specialized in epic breakdown. Your task is to analyze the epic requirements and decompose them into 5-10 discrete user stories following INVEST principles. Context: [Epic/feature context]. Please identify all necessary stories to complete the epic, ensuring comprehensive coverage and proper story boundaries."

**Agent 2 - Authentication Stories Creator (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent focused on authentication and security stories. Your task is to create 2-3 stories covering user authentication, login, registration, and security features from the epic breakdown. Context: [Authentication requirements from epic]. Please create complete stories with titles, descriptions, and initial acceptance criteria."

**Agent 3 - Core Feature Stories Creator (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent specialized in core business feature stories. Your task is to create 2-4 stories covering the main business functionality and user workflows from the epic breakdown. Context: [Core feature requirements]. Please develop stories that deliver primary user value and business objectives."

**Agent 4 - Integration Stories Creator (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent focused on integration and API stories. Your task is to create 1-3 stories covering system integrations, API development, and data flow requirements from the epic breakdown. Context: [Integration requirements]. Please create stories that address system connectivity and data management needs."

**Agent 5 - Acceptance Criteria Developer (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent specialized in comprehensive acceptance criteria development. Your task is to take the stories created by Agents 2-4 and develop detailed Given-When-Then acceptance criteria for each story. Context: [All created stories]. Please ensure every story has complete, testable acceptance criteria covering happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios."

**Agent 6 - Story Dependencies Analyst (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent focused on dependency analysis. Your task is to analyze all created stories and identify dependencies, prerequisites, integration points, and optimal implementation sequence. Context: [Complete story set]. Please map dependencies and recommend story ordering for efficient development flow."

**Agent 7 - Story Estimation Specialist (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent specialized in story estimation. Your task is to analyze all stories and provide story point estimates using Fibonacci scale, considering complexity, technical requirements, and team velocity. Context: [Complete story set with dependencies]. Please provide consistent estimates that support sprint planning."
```

### Phase 2: Story Integration & Synthesis

Apply **Batch Story Integration Matrix**:

1. **Epic-Story Completeness**: Ensure all epic requirements covered by stories
2. **Story-Criteria Alignment**: Validate acceptance criteria fully support each story
3. **Dependencies-Sequence Optimization**: Order stories to minimize blocking dependencies
4. **Estimation-Capacity Consistency**: Ensure estimates support realistic sprint planning
5. **Integration-Development Flow**: Optimize story sequence for continuous value delivery
6. **Quality-Readiness Validation**: Confirm all stories meet Definition of Ready

### Phase 3: Batch Story Finalization

**Batch Story Development Protocol**:
1. Synthesize all agent outputs into cohesive story set
2. Apply integration matrix to ensure story set consistency
3. Validate epic coverage and story completeness
4. Optimize story sequence for development efficiency
5. Present complete story backlog ready for sprint planning
