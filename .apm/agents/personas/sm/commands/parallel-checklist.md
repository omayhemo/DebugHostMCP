## 🚀 EXECUTION PROTOCOL

When user types `/parallel-checklist`:

### Phase 1: Parallel Validation Analysis (6 Agents Simultaneously)

**CRITICAL**: Launch 6 native sub-agents in SINGLE response using natural language activation:

```markdown
I need to perform comprehensive story validation using parallel analysis across all quality dimensions. Let me spawn 6 specialized agents working simultaneously:

**Agent 1 - Story Completeness Validator (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent specialized in story completeness validation. Your task is to validate story structure, description clarity, title appropriateness, and overall story coherence against our story template and INVEST criteria. Context: [Story/stories to validate]. Please ensure all story elements are present, clear, and well-structured for development teams."

**Agent 2 - Business Value Assessor (PO Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Product Owner agent focused on business value validation. Your task is to assess business justification, user value proposition, strategic alignment, and ROI considerations for the stories being validated. Context: [Story/stories with business context]. Please validate that stories deliver meaningful business value and align with product strategy."

**Agent 3 - Technical Feasibility Validator (Architect Agent)**:
"I need you to act as an Architect agent specialized in technical validation. Your task is to assess technical feasibility, architecture alignment, implementation complexity, and integration requirements for the stories. Context: [Story/stories with technical context]. Please validate technical approach and identify any architectural concerns or constraints."

**Agent 4 - Acceptance Criteria Analyzer (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent focused on acceptance criteria validation. Your task is to validate acceptance criteria completeness, testability, clarity, and scenario coverage using Given-When-Then format validation. Context: [Story/stories with acceptance criteria]. Please ensure criteria are comprehensive, testable, and cover all user scenarios including edge cases."

**Agent 5 - Testability Assessor (QA Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a QA agent specialized in testability validation. Your task is to assess story testability, quality gates, validation approaches, and test scenario coverage. Context: [Story/stories with acceptance criteria]. Please validate that stories can be effectively tested and quality assured through our testing framework."

**Agent 6 - Definition of Ready Validator (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent focused on Definition of Ready compliance. Your task is to validate complete DoR compliance including: clear requirements, testable acceptance criteria, technical feasibility confirmed, dependencies identified, story properly estimated, and no blockers present. Context: [Complete story package]. Please provide comprehensive DoR assessment and readiness score."
```

### Phase 2: Validation Integration & Synthesis

Apply **Validation Integration Matrix**:

1. **Completeness-Value Alignment**: Ensure story completeness supports business value delivery
2. **Value-Technical Feasibility**: Validate business value is technically achievable
3. **Technical-Acceptance Consistency**: Confirm acceptance criteria match technical approach
4. **Acceptance-Testability Coverage**: Ensure acceptance criteria enable comprehensive testing
5. **Testability-DoR Compliance**: Validate testability supports Definition of Ready
6. **Integration-Quality Assurance**: Ensure all validation dimensions support story quality

### Phase 3: Validation Results & Recommendations

**Validation Protocol**:
1. Synthesize all agent validation results
2. Apply integration matrix to identify validation gaps
3. Provide comprehensive validation score (0-100%)
4. Generate specific recommendations for story improvement
5. Determine story readiness for development handoff
