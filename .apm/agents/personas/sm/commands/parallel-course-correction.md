## 🚀 EXECUTION PROTOCOL

When user types `/parallel-course-correction`:

### Phase 1: Parallel Situation Analysis (4 Agents Simultaneously)

**CRITICAL**: Launch 4 native sub-agents in SINGLE response using natural language activation:

```markdown
I need to perform comprehensive sprint course correction using parallel analysis across all critical dimensions. Let me spawn 4 specialized agents working simultaneously:

**Agent 1 - Sprint Scope Analyst (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent specialized in sprint scope analysis. Your task is to assess current sprint status, story completion rates, scope deviation from original sprint goals, and identify scope adjustment options (add/remove/modify stories). Context: [Current sprint status and issues]. Please analyze sprint scope reality versus commitments and provide scope adjustment recommendations with impact assessment."

**Agent 2 - Blocker Resolution Specialist (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent focused on blocker identification and resolution. Your task is to identify all current impediments, blockers, and obstacles affecting sprint progress, categorize them by impact and urgency, and develop specific resolution strategies for each. Context: [Sprint challenges and blockers]. Please provide comprehensive blocker analysis with prioritized resolution roadmap."

**Agent 3 - Priority Realignment Analyst (PO Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Product Owner agent specialized in priority assessment. Your task is to analyze current story priorities against business value, market conditions, stakeholder feedback, and strategic objectives to recommend priority adjustments for sprint success. Context: [Business context and priorities]. Please assess priority alignment and recommend adjustments that maximize sprint value delivery."

**Agent 4 - Capacity & Resource Optimizer (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent focused on team capacity optimization. Your task is to analyze team capacity, skill availability, workload distribution, and resource constraints to recommend capacity reallocation and resource optimization strategies. Context: [Team status and capacity]. Please provide capacity analysis with resource optimization recommendations for sprint recovery."
```

### Phase 2: Course Correction Integration & Synthesis

Apply **Course Correction Matrix**:

1. **Scope-Blocker Resolution**: Ensure scope adjustments address identified blockers
2. **Blocker-Priority Alignment**: Validate blocker resolution supports priority objectives
3. **Priority-Capacity Optimization**: Confirm priority adjustments match available capacity
4. **Capacity-Scope Feasibility**: Ensure capacity optimization enables realistic scope delivery
5. **Integration-Sprint Recovery**: Validate all adjustments support sprint goal achievement
6. **Correction-Sustainability**: Ensure corrections maintain team health and future velocity

### Phase 3: Sprint Adjustment Implementation

**Course Correction Protocol**:
1. Synthesize all agent analyses into comprehensive sprint assessment
2. Apply integration matrix to ensure correction coherence
3. Develop prioritized adjustment recommendations with implementation plan
4. Present sprint recovery roadmap with success metrics
5. Provide monitoring framework for adjustment effectiveness
