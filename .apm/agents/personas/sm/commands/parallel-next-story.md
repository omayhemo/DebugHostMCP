## ðŸš€ EXECUTION PROTOCOL

When user types `/parallel-next-story`:

### Phase 1: Parallel Story Development (5 Agents Simultaneously)

**CRITICAL**: Launch 5 native sub-agents in SINGLE response using natural language activation:

```markdown
I need to create a comprehensive story using parallel development. Let me spawn 5 specialized agents working simultaneously:

**Agent 1 - Story Structure Creator (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent focused on story structure creation. Your task is to analyze the current epic/backlog context and create the foundational story structure including title, description, business value, and story overview. Context: [Current epic/feature context]. Please create a well-structured story foundation that follows INVEST principles and provides clear context for development teams."

**Agent 2 - Acceptance Criteria Developer (SM Agent)**:  
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent specialized in acceptance criteria development. Your task is to create comprehensive acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then format for the story being developed. Context: [Story context from Agent 1]. Please develop thorough acceptance criteria covering happy path, edge cases, error handling, and user experience requirements."

**Agent 3 - Technical Requirements Analyst (Developer Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Developer agent focused on technical analysis. Your task is to analyze the story requirements and define technical implementation considerations, architecture impact, complexity assessment, and integration requirements. Context: [Story and criteria context]. Please provide technical guidance that will help development teams implement this story effectively."

**Agent 4 - Test Scenario Creator (QA Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a QA agent specialized in test scenario definition. Your task is to analyze the story and acceptance criteria to create comprehensive test scenarios including unit tests, integration tests, edge cases, and validation approaches. Context: [Full story context]. Please define testability requirements and quality validation approaches."

**Agent 5 - Definition of Ready Validator (SM Agent)**:
"I need you to act as a Scrum Master agent focused on Definition of Ready validation. Your task is to validate the complete story against our DoR criteria ensuring all elements are present: clear requirements, testable acceptance criteria, technical feasibility confirmed, dependencies identified, and story properly estimated. Context: [Complete story package]. Please validate readiness and identify any gaps."
```

### Phase 2: Story Integration & Synthesis

Apply **Next Story Integration Matrix**:

1. **Structure-Criteria Alignment**: Ensure acceptance criteria fully support story structure
2. **Criteria-Technical Feasibility**: Validate acceptance criteria are technically implementable  
3. **Technical-Test Coverage**: Confirm test scenarios cover all technical requirements
4. **Test-Validation Completeness**: Ensure validation approach covers all test scenarios
5. **Integration-Quality Assurance**: Validate complete story meets Definition of Ready
6. **Story-Sprint Readiness**: Confirm story is ready for immediate development start

### Phase 3: Story Finalization

**Story Development Protocol**:
1. Synthesize agent outputs into cohesive story package
2. Apply integration matrix to ensure consistency
3. Validate against Definition of Ready checklist
4. Present complete story with clear development roadmap
5. Provide story points estimation based on technical analysis
