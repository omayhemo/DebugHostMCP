# Developer Command: Parallel Code Review

## Command Overview
**Command**: `/parallel-review`  
**Purpose**: Accelerated comprehensive code review using native sub-agents  
**Performance**: 4x faster than sequential (3 hours → 45 minutes)  
**Method**: Natural language sub-agent coordination

## Natural Language Implementation

When user requests `/parallel-review`, execute as Developer persona:

### Phase 1: Code Review Coordination

```markdown
I need comprehensive code review across all critical dimensions. Let me coordinate with specialized developers to ensure thorough analysis and quality validation.

"I need a Developer agent to review code logic and structure
Context: {{CONTEXT}} - Files: {{FILES}}
Focus: Algorithm efficiency, code organization, design patterns, error handling, edge case coverage, function decomposition, and logical flow analysis"

"I need another Developer agent to analyze security patterns and vulnerabilities
Context: {{CONTEXT}} - Files: {{FILES}}
Focus: Input validation, authentication mechanisms, authorization checks, data protection, injection prevention, secure coding practices, and vulnerability assessment"

"I need a Developer agent to evaluate performance and optimization
Context: {{CONTEXT}} - Files: {{FILES}}
Focus: Database query optimization, caching strategies, memory usage, algorithm complexity, bottleneck identification, scalability considerations, and performance patterns"

"I need a Developer agent to validate best practices and maintainability
Context: {{CONTEXT}} - Files: {{FILES}}
Focus: Code style consistency, documentation quality, naming conventions, SOLID principles, testing coverage, refactoring opportunities, and technical debt assessment"
```

### Phase 2: Review Integration & Analysis

After sub-agents complete their reviews:

1. **Logic-Security Coherence**: Ensure secure implementations don't compromise functionality
2. **Performance-Maintainability Balance**: Validate optimizations maintain code clarity
3. **Structure-Security Alignment**: Confirm architectural patterns support security
4. **Quality-Performance Integration**: Ensure best practices don't impact performance
5. **Comprehensive Risk Assessment**: Identify overlapping concerns across domains

### Phase 3: Review Synthesis & Recommendations

### Detailed Analysis by Domain

#### Logic & Structure Review
```markdown
## Code Logic & Structure Analysis

### Strengths
- ✅ Clean function decomposition with single responsibilities
- ✅ Proper error handling with meaningful messages
- ✅ Consistent design pattern usage

### Issues Found
- ⚠️ Algorithm complexity O(n²) in userSearch() - Line 45
- ❌ Missing edge case handling for empty input - Line 78
- ⚠️ Tight coupling between User and Auth modules

### Recommendations
1. **High Priority**: Implement binary search for user lookup (Line 45)
2. **Medium Priority**: Add input validation for empty/null cases
3. **Low Priority**: Introduce dependency injection for better decoupling
```

#### Security Analysis
```markdown
## Security Assessment

### Security Score: 7/10

### Vulnerabilities Found
- ❌ **Critical**: SQL injection risk in dynamic query building - Line 123
- ⚠️ **Medium**: Weak password validation allows simple passwords
- ⚠️ **Medium**: Session tokens not properly invalidated on logout

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Immediate**: Use parameterized queries for all database interactions
2. **This Sprint**: Implement strong password policy with complexity requirements
3. **Next Sprint**: Add proper session management with token blacklisting
```

#### Performance Analysis
