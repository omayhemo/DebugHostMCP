```

### Measurement Implementation

#### Phase 1: Baseline Establishment
**Execute existing Task-based commands with timing:**

```markdown
## Measurement Protocol
For each command:
1. Record start timestamp
2. Execute complete command workflow
3. Record completion timestamp  
4. Document quality assessment scores
5. Note any errors or issues encountered
6. Calculate total execution time
7. Assess output completeness and quality

## Sample Measurement Entry
Command: parallel-requirements
Start: 2025-07-25 14:00:00
End: 2025-07-25 18:00:00
Duration: 4 hours 0 minutes
Quality Score: 85/100
Issues: 2 Task tool timeouts, 1 context loss
Completeness: 95% (missing technical constraints section)
```

#### Phase 2: Native Implementation Measurement
**Execute migrated commands with comprehensive tracking:**

```markdown
## Enhanced Measurement Protocol
For each migrated command:
1. Record start timestamp with sub-agent coordination
2. Track parallel execution progress across all agents
3. Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network)
4. Record completion timestamp
5. Assess quality using same criteria as baseline
6. Compare output completeness and accuracy
7. Document user experience and satisfaction
8. Calculate improvement ratios

## Sample Measurement Entry  
Command: parallel-requirements (Native)
Start: 2025-07-25 14:00:00
End: 2025-07-25 15:00:00
Duration: 1 hour 0 minutes
Improvement: 4.0x faster
Quality Score: 92/100 (+7 improvement)
Issues: None
Completeness: 100% (all sections included)
Resource Usage: 15% lower CPU, 22% lower memory
```
