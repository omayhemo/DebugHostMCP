# MCP Debug Host Server Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the **MCP Debug Host Server** - a powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that revolutionizes AI development workflows by providing persistent process management and real-time console output visibility.

## 🎯 What is MCP Debug Host Server?

The MCP Debug Host Server solves one of the most frustrating problems in AI-assisted development: **invisible console output**. When AI agents start development servers, you often can't see what's happening. This server creates a persistent bridge between your development processes and AI agents, making everything visible and manageable.
