# Epic 4: Authentication & Multi-User Support

**Epic ID**: EPIC-4  
**Epic Title**: Authentication & Multi-User Support  
**Epic Owner**: Product Owner  
**Status**: Planned  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: August 8, 2025  

## Epic Description

Implement comprehensive authentication and authorization system to support multiple users, teams, and organizations using the MCP Debug Host Platform simultaneously with secure project isolation.

## Business Value

### Primary Business Drivers
- **Team Collaboration**: Enable development teams to share and collaborate on projects securely
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Allow organizations to deploy MCP Debug Host for multiple developers
- **Resource Isolation**: Prevent conflicts between different users' projects and containers
- **Audit & Compliance**: Track user actions for security and operational oversight
- **Scalability**: Support platform growth from single-user to enterprise deployment

### Success Metrics
- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- Project isolation effectiveness (0 cross-user conflicts)
- Authentication response time < 100ms
- 99.9% uptime for authentication service
- Reduced support tickets related to user conflicts by 80%

## User Personas
- **Development Team Lead**: Needs to manage team access and project ownership
- **Enterprise Developer**: Requires secure access to assigned projects only
- **DevOps Engineer**: Needs administrative access for platform management
- **External Contractor**: Requires limited, time-bound access to specific projects

## Epic Stories Breakdown

### Story 4.1: Authentication Framework Integration (8 points)
**As a** platform administrator  
**I want** to integrate a robust authentication system  
**So that** users can securely log in and access their authorized resources  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- OAuth 2.0 / JWT-based authentication
- Integration with popular identity providers (GitHub, Google, Azure AD)
- Local authentication fallback
- Session management and renewal
- Secure token storage and transmission

### Story 4.2: User Management System (13 points)
**As a** platform administrator  
**I want** to manage user accounts, roles, and permissions  
**So that** I can control access and maintain security  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User registration and profile management
- Role-based access control (Admin, Developer, Viewer)
- Permission groups for project access
- User invitation and activation system
- Account suspension and deactivation

### Story 4.3: Project Ownership & Access Control (21 points)
**As a** project owner  
**I want** to control who can access and modify my projects  
**So that** my work remains secure and organized  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Project ownership assignment
- Granular permissions (read, write, execute, admin)
- Team-based project sharing
- Access request and approval workflow
- Project transfer capabilities

### Story 4.4: Resource Isolation & Namespacing (13 points)
**As a** developer  
**I want** my projects isolated from other users  
**So that** I don't experience conflicts or security breaches  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User-specific Docker networks and volumes
- Namespace-based container isolation
- Port allocation per user/team
- Log separation and access control
- Environment variable isolation

### Story 4.5: Audit Logging & Activity Tracking (8 points)
**As a** compliance officer  
**I want** to track all user activities on the platform  
**So that** I can ensure security and regulatory compliance  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Comprehensive audit trail
- User action logging (CRUD operations)
- Failed authentication tracking
- Export capabilities for compliance reporting
- Real-time security alerts

### Story 4.6: Multi-Tenant Dashboard UI (13 points)
**As a** user  
**I want** a personalized dashboard showing only my projects and resources  
**So that** I have a clean, focused experience  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User-specific dashboard views
- Permission-based UI element visibility
- Team collaboration interfaces
- User profile and settings management
- Context switching between teams/organizations

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Changes
- Authentication middleware for all MCP endpoints
- Database schema for user management
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) implementation
- Session management and caching layer
- Multi-tenant data isolation patterns

### Integration Points
- Identity Provider (OAuth) integration
- Database user/role/permission tables
- Docker namespace and network isolation
- MCP tool permission decorators
- Dashboard authentication flow

### Security Considerations
- JWT token security and rotation
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Secure password handling and storage
- Container escape prevention

## Dependencies
- Epic 1-3: Core platform functionality must be stable
- Story 3.1-3.4: Dashboard UI foundation required
- External: Identity provider setup (GitHub OAuth, etc.)

## Constraints & Assumptions
- OAuth integration requires external service registration
- Database schema changes require migration strategy
- Existing single-user projects need migration path
- Performance impact on MCP tool execution < 50ms

## Risks & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and penetration testing
- **Performance Degradation**: Implement caching and optimize database queries
- **Migration Complexity**: Phased rollout with extensive testing

### Medium-Risk Items
- **Identity Provider Downtime**: Implement local authentication fallback
- **Scaling Issues**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start

## Definition of Done
- All authentication flows secure and tested
- User isolation verified through security testing
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation complete for administrators
- Migration path tested for existing users
- Security audit passed

## Estimated Timeline
**Total Story Points**: 76 points  
**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 sprints  
**Target Completion**: Month 3-4  

**Sprint Distribution:**
- Sprint 7: Stories 4.1, 4.2 (21 points)
- Sprint 8: Story 4.3 (21 points)
- Sprint 9: Stories 4.4, 4.5 (21 points)  
- Sprint 10: Story 4.6 (13 points)
- Sprint 11: Integration testing and hardening

## Success Criteria
- Platform supports 100+ concurrent authenticated users
- Zero security incidents in first 90 days post-deployment
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5 for collaboration features
- Performance degradation < 10% with authentication enabled
- 95% of enterprise evaluation criteria met
