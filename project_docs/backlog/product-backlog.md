## Definition of Ready

All stories must meet these criteria before entering a sprint:
- [ ] User story format complete
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Technical requirements documented
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Story pointed
- [ ] No blocking dependencies

## Definition of Done

All stories must meet these criteria for completion:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code written and functioning
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing (where applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed (self-review for single developer)
