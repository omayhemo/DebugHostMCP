# Sprint 1 Plan - Core Infrastructure

**Sprint Number**: 1  
**Duration**: January 6-12, 2025 (1 week)  
**Goal**: Establish foundational infrastructure for MCP Debug Host Platform  
**Total Story Points**: 21  

## Sprint Goal

Build the core infrastructure components that enable containerized application hosting with MCP control, including Docker base images, MCP HTTP server, Docker management, and intelligent port allocation.

## Sprint Backlog

| Story | Title | Points | Priority | Dependencies | Assigned |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|--------------|----------|
| 1.1 | Build Docker Base Images | 8 | High | None | TBD |
| 1.2 | Implement MCP HTTP Server Foundation | 5 | High | None (parallel with 1.1) | TBD |
| 1.3 | Create Docker Manager Module | 5 | High | 1.1 | TBD |
| 1.4 | Develop Port Registry System | 3 | High | 1.2 | TBD |

## Success Criteria

By end of Sprint 1, we should have:
- ✅ 4 Docker base images built and tested
- ✅ MCP server responding on port 2601
- ✅ Docker containers can be created and managed
- ✅ Port allocation working with conflict prevention
- ✅ Basic integration between all components

## Technical Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Docker Engine running
- Node.js 20+ installed
- Network access for npm packages

### Internal Dependencies
- Stories 1.1 and 1.2 can be done in parallel
- Story 1.3 depends on 1.1 (needs base images)
- Story 1.4 integrates with 1.2 (MCP server)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Docker API complexity | High | Medium | Use dockerode library, reference examples |
| MCP protocol implementation | High | Low | Follow specification exactly |
| File watching in PHP | Medium | High | Research inotify-tools thoroughly |
| Port conflicts with system | Medium | Low | Comprehensive port checking |

## Daily Plan

### Day 1-2 (Mon-Tue)
- Start Story 1.1 and 1.2 in parallel
- Focus on Dockerfile creation and MCP server setup

### Day 3 (Wed)
- Complete Story 1.1 (Docker images)
- Continue Story 1.2 (MCP server)

### Day 4 (Thu)
- Complete Story 1.2
- Start Story 1.3 (Docker manager)

### Day 5 (Fri)
- Complete Story 1.3
- Start Story 1.4 (Port registry)

### Day 6 (Sat)
- Complete Story 1.4
- Integration testing

### Day 7 (Sun)
- Bug fixes
- Documentation
- Sprint review preparation

## Definition of Done for Sprint

- [ ] All stories meet their individual DoD
- [ ] Integration test proves components work together
- [ ] Basic error handling in place
- [ ] Code follows project structure
- [ ] No critical bugs remaining
- [ ] Ready for Phase 2 to build upon

## Notes

- This is an aggressive sprint with 21 points, but Stories 1.1 and 1.2 can be parallelized
- Focus on getting basic functionality working; optimization can come later
- Document any architectural decisions made during implementation
- Keep integration simple in Phase 1; full integration comes in Phase 2

## Team Capacity

- **Developer Agent**: Full-time availability
- **Scrum Master**: Daily check-ins and blocker removal
- **Architect**: Available for consultation on design decisions

## Communication Plan

- Daily progress updates in session notes
- Immediate escalation of blockers
- End-of-sprint review with working demo

## Sprint Ceremonies

- **Sprint Planning**: Complete ✅
- **Daily Standups**: Via session notes
- **Sprint Review**: End of Day 7
- **Sprint Retrospective**: After Phase 1 complete
