## üéØ CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. Sprint 4 Capacity Risk
**Issue**: 30 story points exceeds proven velocity by 43%  
**Impact**: High risk of incomplete delivery or quality issues  
**Recommendation**: Split Story 3.4 into two parts (7pts + 6pts)

### 2. Resource Crisis (Sprints 5-8)
**Issue**: 183 story points with single developer (870% of capacity)  
**Impact**: Project timeline failure without intervention  
**Recommendation**: Add second developer immediately or extend timeline by 8 weeks

### 3. Security & Compliance Gaps
**Issue**: No authentication, data sanitization, or audit trails  
**Impact**: Cannot deploy to production without GDPR/SOC 2 compliance  
**Recommendation**: Inject compliance stories into Sprint 3-4 (7-10 points)

### 4. Technical Debt Accumulation
**Issue**: 14 critical security vulnerabilities, performance risks  
**Impact**: Platform stability and security at risk
