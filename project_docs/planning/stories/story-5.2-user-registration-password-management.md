# Story 5.2: User Registration & Password Management

**Story ID**: 5.2  
**Epic**: Authentication & Security Framework (Epic 4)  
**Sprint**: 5  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: August 8, 2025  

## User Story

**As a** new user  
**I want** to register an account with secure password management  
**So that** I can access the MCP Debug Host Platform safely with proper credential handling  

## Business Value

- **User Onboarding**: Enables self-service user registration
- **Security Compliance**: Implements secure password policies and storage
- **Account Recovery**: Provides password reset functionality
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains registration and password change logs

## Acceptance Criteria

### User Registration
1. **GIVEN** a new user wants to register  
   **WHEN** they provide email, password, and basic information  
   **THEN** a new account is created with secure password storage  

2. **GIVEN** a user tries to register with an existing email  
   **WHEN** the registration form is submitted  
   **THEN** an appropriate error message is displayed  

3. **GIVEN** a user provides a weak password  
   **WHEN** attempting registration  
   **THEN** password policy violations are clearly communicated  

### Password Security
4. **GIVEN** a user sets their password  
   **WHEN** the password is stored  
   **THEN** it is hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds ≥12  

5. **GIVEN** password policy requirements exist  
   **WHEN** a user enters a password  
   **THEN** it must be ≥8 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols  

6. **GIVEN** a user enters their password during login  
   **WHEN** authentication occurs  
   **THEN** password verification uses constant-time comparison  

### Password Reset Flow
7. **GIVEN** a user forgets their password  
   **WHEN** they request a password reset  
   **THEN** a secure reset link is sent to their email  

8. **GIVEN** a user clicks a password reset link  
   **WHEN** the link is valid and not expired  
   **THEN** they can set a new password  

9. **GIVEN** a password reset link is used  
   **WHEN** a new password is set  
   **THEN** the reset link becomes invalid  

### Account Management
10. **GIVEN** a logged-in user wants to change their password  
    **WHEN** they provide current and new passwords  
    **THEN** password is updated after current password verification  

11. **GIVEN** a user changes their password  
    **WHEN** the change is successful  
    **THEN** all existing sessions are invalidated except current  

12. **GIVEN** multiple failed login attempts occur  
    **WHEN** threshold is exceeded (5 attempts)  
    **THEN** account is temporarily locked for 15 minutes  

### Email Verification
13. **GIVEN** a user registers a new account  
    **WHEN** registration completes  
    **THEN** a verification email is sent to confirm email address  

14. **GIVEN** a user has an unverified email  
    **WHEN** they try to access protected features  
    **THEN** they are prompted to verify their email first  

15. **GIVEN** a user clicks email verification link  
    **WHEN** the link is valid  
    **THEN** their email is marked as verified  

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  first_name VARCHAR(100),
  last_name VARCHAR(100),
  email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  failed_login_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  locked_until TIMESTAMP NULL,
  last_login TIMESTAMP NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE password_resets (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE email_verifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  verified_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Registration and account management
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/verify-email
POST /auth/resend-verification
POST /auth/forgot-password
POST /auth/reset-password
PUT  /auth/change-password
GET  /auth/profile
PUT  /auth/profile
```

### Password Policy Configuration
```javascript
const passwordPolicy = {
  minLength: 8,
  requireUppercase: true,
  requireLowercase: true,
  requireNumbers: true,
  requireSymbols: true,
  preventCommonPasswords: true,
  preventUserInfoInPassword: true,
  maxPasswordAge: 90, // days
  preventPasswordReuse: 5 // last N passwords
};
```

### Security Features
- bcrypt hashing with configurable salt rounds
- Constant-time password comparison
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Secure password reset tokens (cryptographically random)
- Rate limiting on registration and password reset endpoints
- Email verification requirement for account activation

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Story 5.1 (JWT Authentication Service) - **REQUIRED**
- Email service configuration (SMTP/SendGrid)
- Database migrations and connection
- Input validation middleware

### External Libraries
- `bcryptjs` - Password hashing
- `crypto` - Secure random token generation
- `nodemailer` - Email sending
- `joi` or `yup` - Input validation
- `express-rate-limit` - Rate limiting

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Password hashing and verification
- Password policy validation
- Token generation and validation
- Account lockout logic
- Email verification flow

### Integration Tests
- Complete registration workflow
- Password reset end-to-end flow
- Email verification process
- Account lockout and unlock
- Rate limiting effectiveness

### Security Tests
- Password storage security

- Brute force protection
- Input validation bypass attempts
- Email enumeration protection

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User registration with secure password storage
- [ ] Password policy enforcement with clear feedback
- [ ] Email verification workflow complete
- [ ] Password reset functionality working
- [ ] Account lockout mechanism active
- [ ] Change password feature implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite (>85% coverage)
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Email templates designed and tested
- [ ] Documentation with API examples

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- **Storage**: bcrypt with minimum 12 salt rounds
- **Policy**: Strong password requirements with user guidance
- **Comparison**: Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- **History**: Prevent reuse of last 5 passwords

### Account Protection
- **Lockout**: Progressive delays after failed attempts
- **Reset**: Cryptographically secure reset tokens
- **Enumeration**: Prevent email enumeration attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against brute force and spam

## Story Sizing Justification (8 Points)

This is a **medium-high complexity** story requiring:
- Secure password handling implementation
- Multiple database schema changes
- Email integration and template system
- Complex security considerations
- Account lockout and rate limiting logic
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

The 8-point estimate reflects the multiple security-sensitive components and the need for thorough testing and validation.
