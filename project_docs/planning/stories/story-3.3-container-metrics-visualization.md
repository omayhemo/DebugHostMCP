# Story 3.3: Container Metrics Visualization

**Story ID**: STORY-3.3  
**Phase**: 3 - User Interface  
**Sprint**: 4 (Recommended)  
**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Points**: 17  
**Dependencies**: Story 3.1 (React Dashboard), Story 2.2 (Container Lifecycle Management)  

## Status: Ready for Sprint Planning

## User Story

**As a** developer using the MCP Debug Host Platform dashboard  
**I want** a comprehensive container metrics visualization component integrated into the project detail view  
**So that** I can monitor real-time performance data (CPU usage, memory consumption, network I/O, disk usage) and container health metrics visually, enabling proactive performance optimization and rapid identification of resource bottlenecks in my development containers

## Background

With Story 3.1 providing the React dashboard foundation and Story 3.2 delivering real-time log monitoring, developers now have visual project management capabilities but lack performance visibility. Story 3.3 bridges this gap by integrating comprehensive metrics visualization directly into the dashboard, completing the operational monitoring triumvirate.

The backend infrastructure (Story 2.2) already provides container lifecycle management and health monitoring. This story focuses on creating frontend visualization components that leverage Docker's metrics API through an intuitive, high-performance visual interface.

## Business Value

- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce debugging time by 25% through integrated visual performance monitoring
- **Resource Optimization**: 20% reduction in over-provisioned development containers through data-driven insights
- **Platform Completeness**: Essential component for comprehensive development environment management
- **Performance Culture**: Visual metrics encourage performance-conscious development practices

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Real-time Metrics Streaming
- [ ] **Given** a container is running **When** I view the metrics dashboard **Then** I see real-time CPU, memory, network, and disk metrics updating every 1-5 seconds
- [ ] **Given** metrics are streaming **When** new data arrives **Then** charts update smoothly within 100ms without UI blocking
- [ ] **Given** the WebSocket connection fails **When** automatic reconnection occurs **Then** I see connection status indicators and seamless recovery
- [ ] **Given** multiple containers exist **When** I switch between containers **Then** metrics streams update to show the correct container's data

### 2. CPU Usage Monitoring
- [ ] **Given** a container is running **When** I view CPU metrics **Then** I see percentage usage (0-100%) in real-time line chart
- [ ] **Given** CPU usage history exists **When** I hover over the chart **Then** I see precise timestamps and values in tooltips
- [ ] **Given** CPU spikes occur **When** usage exceeds 80% **Then** visual indicators highlight the anomaly

### 3. Memory Usage Monitoring
- [ ] **Given** a container is running **When** I view memory metrics **Then** I see current usage, limit, and percentage in both chart and text format
- [ ] **Given** memory leaks occur **When** usage trends upward consistently **Then** trend indicators appear warning of potential issues
- [ ] **Given** memory limits exist **When** usage approaches limits **Then** color-coded warnings appear (green <70%, yellow 70-90%, red >90%)
- [ ] **Given** historical data exists **When** I select time ranges **Then** memory usage patterns display for the selected period

### 4. Network I/O Monitoring
- [ ] **Given** network activity occurs **When** I view network metrics **Then** I see bytes sent/received in real-time
- [ ] **Given** multiple network interfaces exist **When** data is displayed **Then** aggregate totals show across all interfaces
- [ ] **Given** network spikes occur **When** traffic exceeds baseline **Then** the chart scale adjusts automatically

### 5. Disk I/O Monitoring
- [ ] **Given** disk operations occur **When** I view disk metrics **Then** I see read/write operations and throughput
- [ ] **Given** disk usage data exists **When** viewing metrics **Then** I see both IOPS and throughput in MB/s
- [ ] **Given** disk bottlenecks occur **When** I/O wait times increase **Then** performance impact indicators appear

### 6. Alert and Notification System
- [ ] **Given** threshold configurations exist **When** metrics exceed thresholds **Then** visual alerts appear in the dashboard
- [ ] **Given** critical alerts trigger **When** viewing any dashboard page **Then** persistent alert badges show on the metrics tab
- [ ] **Given** alerts are active **When** I click on them **Then** I navigate directly to the relevant metric visualization

### 7. Data Export and Reporting
- [ ] **Given** metrics history exists **When** I click Export **Then** I can download data in CSV/JSON formats
- [ ] **Given** time ranges are selected **When** exporting **Then** only data within the range is included
- [ ] **Given** multiple metrics exist **When** exporting **Then** I can select specific metrics to include

### 8. Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Given** large datasets exist **When** rendering charts **Then** data sampling ensures smooth 60fps performance
- [ ] **Given** extended monitoring sessions **When** memory usage is tracked **Then** browser memory stays below 200MB
- [ ] **Given** multiple charts update **When** rendering occurs **Then** updates complete within 50ms using Canvas API

### 9. User Interface and Experience
- [ ] **Given** I use the dashboard **When** navigating to metrics **Then** routing works via /projects/:id/metrics
- [ ] **Given** I use dark/light themes **When** viewing metrics **Then** charts adapt with appropriate color schemes
- [ ] **Given** different screen sizes **When** viewing on tablet/desktop **Then** charts resize responsively maintaining readability
- [ ] **Given** I interact with charts **When** using hover/click **Then** I see detailed tooltips and can toggle metric visibility

### 10. Error Handling
- [ ] **Given** Docker API is unavailable **When** metrics collection fails **Then** clear error messages appear with retry options
- [ ] **Given** invalid metrics data arrives **When** parsing fails **Then** errors are logged without breaking the visualization
- [ ] **Given** high resource usage occurs **When** metrics collection impacts performance **Then** collection automatically throttles with user notification
- [ ] **Given** chart rendering fails **When** browser resources are limited **Then** fallback to simple text metrics display
