# Story 3.2: Real-time Log Viewer Component

**Story ID**: STORY-3.2  
**Phase**: 3 - User Interface  
**Sprint**: 3  
**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Points**: 13  
**Dependencies**: Story 3.1 (React Dashboard), Story 2.3 (Log Management)  

## Status: Ready for Development

## User Story

**As a** developer using the MCP Debug Host Platform dashboard  
**I want** a real-time log viewer component integrated into the project detail view  
**So that** I can visually monitor, search, and analyze my application logs without leaving the dashboard interface, enabling faster debugging and improved development workflow

## Background

With Story 3.1 providing the React dashboard foundation, developers now have a visual project management interface but still must switch to terminal-based logs for debugging. This creates workflow disruption and reduces development efficiency. Story 3.2 bridges this gap by integrating real-time log streaming directly into the dashboard.

The backend infrastructure (Story 2.3) already provides comprehensive log management with SSE streaming capabilities, search indexing, and 3-day retention. This story focuses on creating the frontend components to leverage these capabilities through an intuitive visual interface.

## Business Value

- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce debugging time by 40% through integrated visual log monitoring
- **Platform Adoption**: Complete the minimum viable dashboard experience
- **Team Collaboration**: Enable log sharing and collaborative debugging sessions
- **Foundation Building**: Establish patterns for future real-time dashboard features

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Real-time Log Streaming
- [ ] **Given** a project is selected **When** I navigate to the logs view **Then** I see live log entries streaming in real-time via SSE
- [ ] **Given** logs are streaming **When** new log entries arrive **Then** they appear within 500ms with proper formatting and timestamps
- [ ] **Given** the SSE connection fails **When** automatic reconnection occurs **Then** I see connection status indicators and seamless reconnection
- [ ] **Given** multiple projects exist **When** I switch between projects **Then** log streams update to show the correct project's logs

### 2. Search and Filtering
- [ ] **Given** historical logs exist **When** I enter search terms **Then** I see filtered results within 2 seconds
- [ ] **Given** I apply log level filters **When** I select ERROR/WARN/INFO **Then** only matching log entries display
- [ ] **Given** I set time range filters **When** I specify start/end dates **Then** logs display within the specified time window
- [ ] **Given** I combine multiple filters **When** search + level + time filters are active **Then** all criteria are applied correctly

### 3. User Interface Behaviors
- [ ] **Given** logs are streaming **When** auto-scroll is enabled **Then** the view automatically scrolls to show latest entries
- [ ] **Given** I want to examine specific entries **When** I pause auto-scroll **Then** streaming continues but view remains fixed
- [ ] **Given** I want a clean view **When** I click Clear **Then** displayed logs clear but streaming continues
- [ ] **Given** I use dark/light themes **When** theme changes **Then** log colors and syntax highlighting adapt appropriately
- [ ] **Given** I use different screen sizes **When** viewing on tablet/desktop **Then** log viewer adapts responsively

### 4. Error Handling
- [ ] **Given** the MCP server is unavailable **When** connection fails **Then** I see clear error messages with retry options
- [ ] **Given** network timeouts occur **When** requests exceed 10 seconds **Then** I see timeout indicators and can retry
- [ ] **Given** extremely high log volumes occur **When** >1000 logs/second stream **Then** system throttles gracefully with user notification
- [ ] **Given** malformed log data arrives **When** invalid JSON is received **Then** errors are logged and valid entries continue displaying

### 5. Export Functionality
- [ ] **Given** I want to save logs **When** I click Export All **Then** I can download complete log history in JSON/CSV/TXT formats
- [ ] **Given** I have filtered results **When** I click Export Filtered **Then** only matching entries are exported
- [ ] **Given** I specify time ranges **When** I export custom ranges **Then** only logs within the range are included

### 6. Performance Requirements
- [ ] **Given** streaming is active **When** monitoring latency **Then** log entries appear within 500ms of generation
- [ ] **Given** I perform searches **When** querying large datasets **Then** results return within 2 seconds
- [ ] **Given** continuous usage **When** monitoring memory usage **Then** log viewer uses <100MB RAM with proper cleanup
- [ ] **Given** extended sessions **When** SSE connections run >1 hour **Then** connection uptime exceeds 99% with automatic recovery

### 7. Dashboard Integration
- [ ] **Given** I'm in the dashboard **When** I navigate to project logs **Then** routing works seamlessly via /projects/:id/logs
- [ ] **Given** dashboard state exists **When** log viewer loads **Then** project context, theme, and user preferences are preserved
- [ ] **Given** I switch between projects **When** using navigation **Then** log state resets appropriately for the new project

### 8. Accessibility
- [ ] **Given** I use keyboard navigation **When** interacting with log viewer **Then** all functions are accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] **Given** I use screen readers **When** logs stream **Then** new entries are announced with proper ARIA labels
- [ ] **Given** I need high contrast **When** using accessibility modes **Then** log colors meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
