## 📊 Capacity Analysis

### Team Velocity
- **Sprint 1 Velocity**: 21 points (100% success rate)
- **Sprint 2 Target**: 21 points (matching proven capacity)
- **Velocity Confidence**: High (exact match to proven baseline)

### Resource Allocation
- **Developer Agent**: Full-time availability (proven in Sprint 1)
- **Parallel Development**: 4 concurrent story implementation capability (validated)
- **SM Coordination**: Sprint planning, monitoring, and facilitation

### Sprint Capacity Validation ✅
- **Total Points**: 21 (matches Sprint 1 baseline)
- **Story Distribution**: Balanced complexity across 4 stories
- **Dependency Chain**: Logical sequence with parallel execution opportunities
- **Risk Level**: Manageable (1 Low, 3 Medium risk stories)

## 🔄 Dependencies and Sequencing

### Dependency Chain
1. **Story 2.1** (Project Registration) → Must complete first (enables other stories)
2. **Story 2.2** (Container Lifecycle) → Depends on 2.1, enables logging
3. **Story 2.3** (Log Management) → Depends on 2.2 for container integration
4. **Story 2.4** (Error Handling) → Cross-cutting, integrates with all stories

### Parallel Execution Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Stories 2.1 + 2.4 (parallel development possible)
- **Phase 2**: Stories 2.2 + 2.3 (after 2.1 completion)
- **Phase 3**: Integration testing and error handling integration

### Critical Path
Story 2.1 → Story 2.2 → Story 2.3 (with 2.4 threading throughout)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Target
- **Coverage**: >80% for all new components
- **Test Files**: 16 new test files estimated
- **Testing Framework**: Jest (configured and operational from Sprint 1)

### Integration Testing
- **Container Integration**: Docker lifecycle with logging
- **MCP Tool Integration**: All new tools with existing infrastructure  
- **Error Recovery Testing**: Failure injection and recovery validation

### Performance Testing
- **Log Streaming**: Real-time performance under load
- **Container Operations**: Start/stop/restart timing
- **Registration**: Workspace scanning performance

## 💼 Business Value

### Sprint 2 Deliverables
1. **Complete Project Management**: End-to-end project lifecycle through Claude Code
2. **Real-time Development Monitoring**: Live log streaming and container status
3. **Robust Error Recovery**: Automatic system resilience and user-friendly error handling
4. **Foundation for Phase 3**: UI-ready backend services

### Success Metrics
- Project registration success rate >95%
- Container start time <10 seconds average
- Log streaming latency <100ms
- System uptime >99.5% with error handling
- Zero critical errors during normal operations
